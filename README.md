Symmetric key cypher utilizing 3D arrays to encrypt to colour values.

	It does things and stuff.

./Sample Videos/
Contains three videos:

	-Small Length With Rendering.mp4 video shows the text encrypted to colour values, rendered then decrypted.
	-Long Length No Rendering.mp4 shows large text encrypted then decrypted.
	-Build 0.1.2_LargeFile.mp4 shows superior speed in built version.
	-Vector3ToChar_SecondLayer.mp4 shows the second layer of encryption in effect. Plaintext->Vector3Int Array->Char Array
	-CreateTexture.mp4 shows writing data to pixels in a texture ready for reading and decrypting via GetPixel.

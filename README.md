Symmetric key cypher utilizing 3D arrays to encrypt to colour values + more.

	It does things and stuff.

./Sample Videos/

	- "Small Length With Rendering.mp4" video shows the text encrypted to colour values, rendered then decrypted.
	- "Long Length No Rendering.mp4" shows large text encrypted then decrypted.
	- "Build 0.1.2_LargeFile.mp4" shows superior speed in built version.
	- "Vector3ToChar_SecondLayer.mp4" shows the second layer of encryption in effect. Plaintext->Vector3Int Array->Char Array
	- "CreateTexture.mp4" shows writing data to pixels in a texture ready for reading and decrypting via GetPixel.
	- "0.1.5_With_String_Builder" shows refactor using StringBuilder for major speed gains in encryption and decryption of Alice29.txt

    Lewis Carroll\r\n\r\n               THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 2.9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           
    CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                      Down the Rabbit-Hole\r\n\r\n\r\n  Alice
    was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister\r\non the bank, and
    of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had\r\npeeped into the book her sister
    was reading, but it had no\r\npictures or conversations in it, `and what is the
    use of a book,'\r\nthought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'\r\n\r\n 
    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,\r\nfor the hot
    day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether\r\nthe pleasure of making
    a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble\r\nof getting up and picking the daisies,
    when suddenly a White\r\nRabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\r\n\r\n  There
    was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice\r\nthink it so VERY much
    out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to\r\nitself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall
    be late!'  (when she thought\r\nit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she
    ought to have\r\nwondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\r\nbut
    when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\r\nPOCKET, and looked
    at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to\r\nher feet, for it flashed across
    her mind that she had never\r\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket,
    or a watch to\r\ntake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\r\nfield
    after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\r\ndown a large rabbit-hole
    under the hedge.\r\n\r\n  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once\r\nconsidering
    how in the world she was to get out again.\r\n\r\n  The rabbit-hole went straight
    on like a tunnel for some way,\r\nand then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly
    that Alice had not a\r\nmoment to think about stopping herself before she found
    herself\r\nfalling down a very deep well.\r\n\r\n  Either the well was very deep,
    or she fell very slowly, for she\r\nhad plenty of time as she went down to look
    about her and to\r\nwonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to
    look\r\ndown and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to\r\nsee
    anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\r\nnoticed that they
    were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;\r\nhere and there she saw maps and
    pictures hung upon pegs.  She\r\ntook down a jar from one of the shelves as she
    passed; it was\r\nlabelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment
    it\r\nwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing\r\nsomebody,
    so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she\r\nfell past it.\r\n\r\n 
    `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I\r\nshall think
    nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll\r\nall think me at home! 
    Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,\r\neven if I fell off the top of the house!'
    (Which was very likely\r\ntrue.)\r\n\r\n  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER
    come to an end!  `I\r\nwonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said
    aloud.\r\n`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let\r\nme
    see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,\r\nyou see, Alice
    had learnt several things of this sort in her\r\nlessons in the schoolroom, and
    though this was not a VERY good\r\nopportunity for showing off her knowledge,
    as there was no one to\r\nlisten to her, still it was good practice to say it
    over) `--yes,\r\nthat's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\r\nor
    Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,\r\nor Longitude
    either, but thought they were nice grand words to\r\nsay.)\r\n\r\n  Presently
    she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right\r\nTHROUGH the earth!  How
    funny it'll seem to come out among the\r\npeople that walk with their heads downward! 
    The Antipathies, I\r\nthink--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening,
    this\r\ntime, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall\r\nhave
    to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\r\nPlease, Ma'am, is this
    New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried\r\nto curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING
    as you're falling\r\nthrough the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And
    what\r\nan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll\r\nnever
    do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\r\n\r\n  Down, down,
    down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon\r\nbegan talking again.  `Dinah'll
    miss me very much to-night, I\r\nshould think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope
    they'll remember\r\nher saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you
    were\r\ndown here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but\r\nyou
    might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.\r\nBut do cats eat
    bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get\r\nrather sleepy, and went on saying
    to herself, in a dreamy sort of\r\nway, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?'
    and sometimes, `Do\r\nbats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\r\nquestion,
    it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt\r\nthat she was dozing
    off, and had just begun to dream that she\r\nwas walking hand in hand with Dinah,
    and saying to her very\r\nearnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you
    ever eat a\r\nbat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\r\nsticks
    and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\r\n\r\n  Alice was not a bit hurt, and
    she jumped up on to her feet in a\r\nmoment:  she looked up, but it was all dark
    overhead; before her\r\nwas another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still
    in\r\nsight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:\r\naway went
    Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it\r\nsay, as it turned a corner,
    `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\r\nit's getting!'  She was close behind it
    when she turned the\r\ncorner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she
    found\r\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\r\nhanging
    from the roof.\r\n\r\n  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all
    locked;\r\nand when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\r\nother,
    trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\r\nwondering how she was
    ever to get out again.\r\n\r\n  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged
    table, all made of\r\nsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden
    key,\r\nand Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\r\ndoors
    of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\r\nthe key was too
    small, but at any rate it would not open any of\r\nthem.  However, on the second
    time round, she came upon a low\r\ncurtain she had not noticed before, and behind
    it was a little\r\ndoor about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden
    key\r\nin the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\r\n\r\n  Alice opened
    the door and found that it led into a small\r\npassage, not much larger than
    a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\r\nlooked along the passage into the loveliest
    garden you ever saw.\r\nHow she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander
    about\r\namong those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\r\nshe
    could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if\r\nmy head would
    go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\r\nvery little use without my
    shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\r\nI could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could,
    if I only\r\nknow how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\r\nhad
    happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\r\nthings indeed
    were really impossible.\r\n\r\n  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the
    little door, so she\r\nwent back to the table, half hoping she might find another
    key on\r\nit, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\r\ntelescopes: 
    this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\r\ncertainly was not here
    before,' said Alice,) and round the neck\r\nof the bottle was a paper label,
    with the words `DRINK ME'\r\nbeautifully printed on it in large letters.\r\n\r\n 
    It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\r\nAlice was not
    going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look\r\nfirst,' she said, `and see whether
    it's marked \"poison\" or not';\r\nfor she had read several nice little histories
    about children who\r\nhad got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\r\nthings,
    all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\r\ntheir friends had taught
    them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\r\nwill burn you if you hold it too long;
    and that if you cut your\r\nfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds;
    and she had\r\nnever forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\r\n`poison,'
    it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n  However,
    this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\r\nto taste it, and finding
    it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\r\nof mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard,
    pine-apple, roast\r\nturkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\r\nit
    off.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        
    *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     *       *       *      
    *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must
    be shutting up\r\nlike a telescope.'\r\n\r\n  And so it was indeed:  she was
    now only ten inches high, and\r\nher face brightened up at the thought that she
    was now the right\r\nsize for going though the little door into that lovely garden.\r\nFirst,
    however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was\r\ngoing to shrink any
    further:  she felt a little nervous about\r\nthis; `for it might end, you know,'
    said Alice to herself, `in my\r\ngoing out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder
    what I should be\r\nlike then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle
    is\r\nlike after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\r\never
    having seen such a thing.\r\n\r\n  After a while, finding that nothing more happened,
    she decided\r\non going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when\r\nshe
    got to the door, she found he had forgotten the little golden\r\nkey, and when
    she went back to the table for it, she found she\r\ncould not possibly reach
    it:  she could see it quite plainly\r\nthrough the glass, and she tried her best
    to climb up one of the\r\nlegs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when
    she had\r\ntired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and\r\ncried.\r\n\r\n 
    `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to\r\nherself, rather
    sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'\r\nShe generally gave herself
    very good advice, (though she very\r\nseldom followed it), and sometimes she
    scolded herself so\r\nseverely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she
    remembered\r\ntrying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game\r\nof
    croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious\r\nchild was very fond
    of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no\r\nuse now,' thought poor Alice,
    `to pretend to be two people!  Why,\r\nthere's hardly enough of me left to make
    ONE respectable\r\nperson!'\r\n\r\n  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box
    that was lying under\r\nthe table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small
    cake, on\r\nwhich the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.\r\n`Well,
    I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,\r\nI can reach the
    key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep\r\nunder the door; so either
    way I'll get into the garden, and I\r\ndon't care which happens!'\r\n\r\n  She
    ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which\r\nway?  Which way?',
    holding her hand on the top of her head to\r\nfeel which way it was growing,
    and she was quite surprised to\r\nfind that she remained the same size:  to be
    sure, this generally\r\nhappens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much
    into the\r\nway of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,\r\nthat
    it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the\r\ncommon way.\r\n\r\n 
    So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\r\n\r\n     *      
    *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n         *       *       *      
    *       *       *\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *       *      
    *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                       
    The Pool of Tears\r\n\r\n\r\n  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was
    so much\r\nsurprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good\r\nEnglish);
    `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that\r\never was!  Good-bye,
    feet!' (for when she looked down at her\r\nfeet, they seemed to be almost out
    of sight, they were getting so\r\nfar off).  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder
    who will put on\r\nyour shoes and stockings for you now, dears?  I'm sure _I_
    shan't\r\nbe able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself\r\nabout
    you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be\r\nkind to them,'
    thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the\r\nway I want to go!  Let me see: 
    I'll give them a new pair of\r\nboots every Christmas.'\r\n\r\n  And she went
    on planning to herself how she would manage it.\r\n`They must go by the carrier,'
    she thought; `and how funny it'll\r\nseem, sending presents to one's own feet! 
    And how odd the\r\ndirections will look!\r\n\r\n            ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT,
    ESQ.\r\n                HEARTHRUG,\r\n                    NEAR THE FENDER,\r\n                       
    (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).\r\n\r\nOh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'\r\n\r\n  Just
    then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in\r\nfact she was now more
    than nine feet high, and she at once took\r\nup the little golden key and hurried
    off to the garden door.\r\n\r\n  Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do,
    lying down on one\r\nside, to look through into the garden with one eye; but
    to get\r\nthrough was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to\r\ncry
    again.\r\n\r\n  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great\r\ngirl
    like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in\r\nthis way!  Stop
    this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all\r\nthe same, shedding gallons
    of tears, until there was a large pool\r\nall round her, about four inches deep
    and reaching half down the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\n  After a time she heard a little
    pattering of feet in the\r\ndistance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what
    was coming.\r\nIt was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a\r\npair
    of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the\r\nother:  he came trotting
    along in a great hurry, muttering to\r\nhimself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess,
    the Duchess! Oh! won't she\r\nbe savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt
    so desperate\r\nthat she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit\r\ncame
    near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,\r\nsir--'  The Rabbit
    started violently, dropped the white kid\r\ngloves and the fan, and skurried
    away into the darkness as hard\r\nas he could go.\r\n\r\n  Alice took up the
    fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very\r\nhot, she kept fanning herself all
    the time she went on talking:\r\n`Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day! 
    And yesterday\r\nthings went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed
    in\r\nthe night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this\r\nmorning? 
    I almost think I can remember feeling a little\r\ndifferent.  But if I'm not
    the same, the next question is, Who in\r\nthe world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great
    puzzle!'  And she began\r\nthinking over all the children she knew that were
    of the same age\r\nas herself, to see if she could have been changed for any
    of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n  `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in
    such\r\nlong ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm\r\nsure
    I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,\r\noh! she knows such
    a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,\r\nand--oh dear, how puzzling
    it all is!  I'll try if I know all the\r\nthings I used to know.  Let me see: 
    four times five is twelve,\r\nand four times six is thirteen, and four times
    seven is--oh dear!\r\nI shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, the\r\nMultiplication
    Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.\r\nLondon is the capital of Paris,
    and Paris is the capital of Rome,\r\nand Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! 
    I must have been\r\nchanged for Mabel!  I'll try and say \"How doth the little--\"'\r\nand
    she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,\r\nand began
    to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and\r\nstrange, and the words did
    not come the same as they used to do:--\r\n\r\n            `How doth the little
    crocodile\r\n              Improve his shining tail,\r\n            And pour
    the waters of the Nile\r\n              On every golden scale!\r\n\r\n           
    `How cheerfully he seems to grin,\r\n              How neatly spread his claws,\r\n           
    And welcome little fishes in\r\n              With gently smiling jaws!'\r\n\r\n 
    `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and\r\nher eyes filled
    with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel\r\nafter all, and I shall have
    to go and live in that poky little\r\nhouse, and have next to no toys to play
    with, and oh! ever so\r\nmany lessons to learn!  No, I've made up my mind about
    it; if I'm\r\nMabel, I'll stay down here!  It'll be no use their putting their\r\nheads
    down and saying \"Come up again, dear!\"  I shall only look\r\nup and say \"Who
    am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I\r\nlike being that person, I'll
    come up:  if not, I'll stay down\r\nhere till I'm somebody else\"--but, oh dear!'
    cried Alice, with a\r\nsudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their
    heads\r\ndown!  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'\r\n\r\n  As she
    said this she looked down at her hands, and was\r\nsurprised to see that she
    had put on one of the Rabbit's little\r\nwhite kid gloves while she was talking. 
    `How CAN I have done\r\nthat?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.' 
    She got up\r\nand went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,\r\nas
    nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,\r\nand was going
    on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the\r\ncause of this was the fan
    she was holding, and she dropped it\r\nhastily, just in time to avoid shrinking
    away altogether.\r\n\r\n`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened
    at\r\nthe sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in\r\nexistence;
    `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed\r\nback to the little door: 
    but, alas! the little door was shut\r\nagain, and the little golden key was lying
    on the glass table as\r\nbefore, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the
    poor child,\r\n`for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare\r\nit's
    too bad, that it is!'\r\n\r\n  As she said these words her foot slipped, and
    in another\r\nmoment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  He first\r\nidea
    was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that\r\ncase I can go back
    by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had\r\nbeen to the seaside once in
    her life, and had come to the general\r\nconclusion, that wherever you go to
    on the English coast you find\r\na number of bathing machines in the sea, some
    children digging in\r\nthe sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses,
    and\r\nbehind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that\r\nshe
    was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine\r\nfeet high.\r\n\r\n 
    `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,\r\ntrying to
    find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I\r\nsuppose, by being drowned
    in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer\r\nthing, to be sure!  However, everything
    is queer to-day.'\r\n\r\n  Just then she heard something splashing about in the
    pool a\r\nlittle way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at\r\nfirst
    she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then\r\nshe remembered how
    small she was now, and she soon made out that\r\nit was only a mouse that had
    slipped in like herself.\r\n\r\n  `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice,
    `to speak to this\r\nmouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that
    I should\r\nthink very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in\r\ntrying.' 
    So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of\r\nthis pool?  I am very
    tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'\r\n(Alice thought this must be the right
    way of speaking to a mouse:\r\nshe had never done such a thing before, but she
    remembered having\r\nseen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to
    a\r\nmouse--a mouse--O mouse!'  The Mouse looked at her rather\r\ninquisitively,
    and seemed to her to wink with one of its little\r\neyes, but it said nothing.\r\n\r\n 
    `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I\r\ndaresay it's a
    French mouse, come over with William the\r\nConqueror.'  (For, with all her knowledge
    of history, Alice had\r\nno very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) 
    So she\r\nbegan again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in\r\nher
    French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the\r\nwater, and seemed
    to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I beg\r\nyour pardon!' cried Alice hastily,
    afraid that she had hurt the\r\npoor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you
    didn't like cats.'\r\n\r\n  `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate\r\nvoice. 
    `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'\r\n\r\n  `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice
    in a soothing tone:  `don't be\r\nangry about it.  And yet I wish I could show
    you our cat Dinah:\r\nI think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see
    her.\r\nShe is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,\r\nas
    she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so\r\nnicely by the
    fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and\r\nshe is such a nice soft thing
    to nurse--and she's such a capital\r\none for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!'
    cried Alice again,\r\nfor this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she
    felt\r\ncertain it must be really offended.  `We won't talk about her any\r\nmore
    if you'd rather not.'\r\n\r\n  `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling
    down to the end\r\nof his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our
    family\r\nalways HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear\r\nthe
    name again!'\r\n\r\n  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change
    the\r\nsubject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'\r\nThe
    Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is\r\nsuch a nice little
    dog near our house I should like to show you!\r\nA little bright-eyed terrier,
    you know, with oh, such long curly\r\nbrown hair!  And it'll fetch things when
    you throw them, and\r\nit'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of
    things--I\r\ncan't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you\r\nknow,
    and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!\r\nHe says it kills
    all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a\r\nsorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've
    offended it again!'  For the\r\nMouse was swimming away from her as hard as it
    could go, and\r\nmaking quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\r\n\r\n  So
    she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back\r\nagain, and we won't
    talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't\r\nlike them!'  When the Mouse heard
    this, it turned round and swam\r\nslowly back to her:  its face was quite pale
    (with passion, Alice\r\nthought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let
    us get to\r\nthe shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll\r\nunderstand
    why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\r\n\r\n  It was high time to go, for the pool
    was getting quite crowded\r\nwith the birds and animals that had fallen into
    it:  there were a\r\nDuck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other
    curious\r\ncreatures.  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          
    CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                  A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\r\n\r\n\r\n 
    They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the\r\nbank--the birds
    with draggled feathers, the animals with their\r\nfur clinging close to them,
    and all dripping wet, cross, and\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\n  The first question
    of course was, how to get dry again:  they\r\nhad a consultation about this,
    and after a few minutes it seemed\r\nquite natural to Alice to find herself talking
    familiarly with\r\nthem, as if she had known them all her life.  Indeed, she
    had\r\nquite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,\r\nand
    would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';\r\nand this Alice
    would not allow without knowing how old it was,\r\nand, as the Lory positively
    refused to tell its age, there was no\r\nmore to be said.\r\n\r\n  At last the
    Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among\r\nthem, called out, `Sit
    down, all of you, and listen to me!  I'LL\r\nsoon make you dry enough!'  They
    all sat down at once, in a large\r\nring, with the Mouse in the middle.  Alice
    kept her eyes\r\nanxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad\r\ncold
    if she did not get dry very soon.\r\n\r\n  `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important
    air, `are you all ready?\r\nThis is the driest thing I know.  Silence all round,
    if you please!\r\n\"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope,
    was\r\nsoon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been\r\nof
    late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.  Edwin and\r\nMorcar, the earls
    of Mercia and Northumbria--\"'\r\n\r\n  `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.\r\n\r\n 
    `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very\r\npolitely:  `Did you
    speak?'\r\n\r\n  `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.\r\n\r\n  `I thought you did,'
    said the Mouse.  `--I proceed.  \"Edwin and\r\nMorcar, the earls of Mercia and
    Northumbria, declared for him:\r\nand even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop
    of Canterbury, found\r\nit advisable--\"'\r\n\r\n  `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.\r\n\r\n 
    `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly:  `of course you\r\nknow what \"it\"
    means.'\r\n\r\n  `I know what \"it\" means well enough, when I find a thing,'
    said\r\nthe Duck:  `it's generally a frog or a worm.  The question is,\r\nwhat
    did the archbishop find?'\r\n\r\n  The Mouse did not notice this question, but
    hurriedly went on,\r\n`\"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet
    William\r\nand offer him the crown.  William's conduct at first was\r\nmoderate. 
    But the insolence of his Normans--\"  How are you\r\ngetting on now, my dear?'
    it continued, turning to Alice as it\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n  `As wet as ever,' said
    Alice in a melancholy tone:  `it doesn't\r\nseem to dry me at all.'\r\n\r\n 
    `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I\r\nmove that the
    meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more\r\nenergetic remedies--'\r\n\r\n 
    `Speak English!' said the Eaglet.  `I don't know the meaning of\r\nhalf those
    long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do\r\neither!'  And the Eaglet
    bent down its head to hide a smile:\r\nsome of the other birds tittered audibly.\r\n\r\n 
    `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,\r\n`was, that the
    best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'\r\n\r\n  `What IS a Caucus-race?'
    said Alice; not that she wanted much\r\nto know, but the Dodo had paused as if
    it thought that SOMEBODY\r\nought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to
    say anything.\r\n\r\n  `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to
    do it.'\r\n(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter\r\nday,
    I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\r\n\r\n  First it marked out a race-course,
    in a sort of circle, (`the\r\nexact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then
    all the party\r\nwere placed along the course, here and there.  There was no
    `One,\r\ntwo, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,\r\nand
    left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know\r\nwhen the race was
    over.  However, when they had been running half\r\nan hour or so, and were quite
    dry again, the Dodo suddenly called\r\nout `The race is over!' and they all crowded
    round it, panting,\r\nand asking, `But who has won?'\r\n\r\n  This question the
    Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\r\nthought, and it sat for a long
    time with one finger pressed upon\r\nits forehead (the position in which you
    usually see Shakespeare,\r\nin the pictures of him), while the rest waited in
    silence.  At\r\nlast the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have\r\nprizes.'\r\n\r\n 
    `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n 
    `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with\r\none finger; and
    the whole party at once crowded round her,\r\ncalling out in a confused way,
    `Prizes! Prizes!'\r\n\r\n  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put
    her hand\r\nin her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt\r\nwater
    had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.\r\nThere was exactly one
    a-piece all round.\r\n\r\n  `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said
    the Mouse.\r\n\r\n  `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely.  `What else have\r\nyou
    got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Only a thimble,'
    said Alice sadly.\r\n\r\n  `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.\r\n\r\n  Then
    they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo\r\nsolemnly presented the
    thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of\r\nthis elegant thimble'; and, when
    it had finished this short\r\nspeech, they all cheered.\r\n\r\n  Alice thought
    the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked\r\nso grave that she did not
    dare to laugh; and, as she could not\r\nthink of anything to say, she simply
    bowed, and took the thimble,\r\nlooking as solemn as she could.\r\n\r\n  The
    next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noise\r\nand confusion,
    as the large birds complained that they could not\r\ntaste theirs, and the small
    ones choked and had to be patted on\r\nthe back.  However, it was over at last,
    and they sat down again\r\nin a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something
    more.\r\n\r\n  `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,\r\n`and
    why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half\r\nafraid that it
    would be offended again.\r\n\r\n  `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse,
    turning to\r\nAlice, and sighing.\r\n\r\n  `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said
    Alice, looking down with\r\nwonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call
    it sad?'  And\r\nshe kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking,
    so\r\nthat her idea of the tale was something like this:--\r\n\r\n                   
    `Fury said to a\r\n                   mouse, That he\r\n                 met
    in the\r\n               house,\r\n            \"Let us\r\n              both
    go to\r\n                law:  I will\r\n                  prosecute\r\n                   
    YOU.  --Come,\r\n                       I'll take no\r\n                       
    denial; We\r\n                     must have a\r\n                 trial:  For\r\n             
    really this\r\n           morning I've\r\n          nothing\r\n         to do.\"\r\n          
    Said the\r\n             mouse to the\r\n               cur, \"Such\r\n

    be\r\n                 judge, I'll\r\n                   be jury,\"\r\n                        
    Said\r\n                    cunning\r\n                      old Fury:\r\n                    
    \"I'll\r\n                      try the\r\n                         whole\r\n

    `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.\r\n`What are you thinking
    of?'\r\n\r\n  `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly:  `you had got to\r\nthe
    fifth bend, I think?'\r\n\r\n  `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very
    angrily.\r\n\r\n  `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful,
    and\r\nlooking anxiously about her.  `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'\r\n\r\n 
    `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up\r\nand walking away. 
    `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'\r\n\r\n  `I didn't mean it!' pleaded
    poor Alice.  `But you're so easily\r\noffended, you know!'\r\n\r\n  The Mouse
    only growled in reply.\r\n\r\n  `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice
    called after\r\nit; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but\r\nthe
    Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little\r\nquicker.\r\n\r\n 
    `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it\r\nwas quite out
    of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of\r\nsaying to her daughter `Ah,
    my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you\r\nnever to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your
    tongue, Ma!' said the\r\nyoung Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to
    try the\r\npatience of an oyster!'\r\n\r\n  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know
    I do!' said Alice aloud,\r\naddressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch
    it back!'\r\n\r\n  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'\r\nsaid
    the Lory.\r\n\r\n  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about\r\nher
    pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And she's such a capital one for\r\ncatching mice you
    can't think!  And oh, I wish you could see her\r\nafter the birds!  Why, she'll
    eat a little bird as soon as look\r\nat it!'\r\n\r\n  This speech caused a remarkable
    sensation among the party.\r\nSome of the birds hurried off at once:  one the
    old Magpie began\r\nwrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must
    be\r\ngetting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary\r\ncalled
    out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my\r\ndears!  It's high
    time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts\r\nthey all moved off, and Alice
    was soon left alone.\r\n\r\n  `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to
    herself in a\r\nmelancholy tone.  `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm\r\nsure
    she's the best cat in the world!  Oh, my dear Dinah!  I\r\nwonder if I shall
    ever see you any more!'  And here poor Alice\r\nbegan to cry again, for she felt
    very lonely and low-spirited.\r\nIn a little while, however, she again heard
    a little pattering of\r\nfootsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly,
    half hoping\r\nthat the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to\r\nfinish
    his story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n               
    The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n  It was the White Rabbit, trotting
    slowly back again, and\r\nlooking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost
    something;\r\nand she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!  The Duchess!\r\nOh
    my dear paws!  Oh my fur and whiskers!  She'll get me\r\nexecuted, as sure as
    ferrets are ferrets!  Where CAN I have\r\ndropped them, I wonder?'  Alice guessed
    in a moment that it was\r\nlooking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,
    and she\r\nvery good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were\r\nnowhere
    to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her\r\nswim in the pool,
    and the great hall, with the glass table and\r\nthe little door, had vanished
    completely.\r\n\r\n  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting
    about,\r\nand called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE\r\nyou
    doing out here?  Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of\r\ngloves and a
    fan!  Quick, now!'  And Alice was so much frightened\r\nthat she ran off at once
    in the direction it pointed to, without\r\ntrying to explain the mistake it had
    made.\r\n\r\n  `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.\r\n`How
    surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!  But I'd\r\nbetter take him his
    fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'\r\nAs she said this, she came upon
    a neat little house, on the door\r\nof which was a bright brass plate with the
    name `W. RABBIT'\r\nengraved upon it.  She went in without knocking, and hurried\r\nupstairs,
    in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,\r\nand be turned out of
    the house before she had found the fan and\r\ngloves.\r\n\r\n  `How queer it
    seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going\r\nmessages for a rabbit!  I suppose
    Dinah'll be sending me on\r\nmessages next!'  And she began fancying the sort
    of thing that\r\nwould happen:  `\"Miss Alice!  Come here directly, and get ready\r\nfor
    your walk!\" \"Coming in a minute, nurse!  But I've got to see\r\nthat the mouse
    doesn't get out.\"  Only I don't think,' Alice went\r\non, `that they'd let Dinah
    stop in the house if it began ordering\r\npeople about like that!'\r\n\r\n  By
    this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with\r\na table in the
    window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two\r\nor three pairs of tiny
    white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and\r\na pair of the gloves, and was just
    going to leave the room, when\r\nher eye fell upon a little bottle that stood
    near the looking-\r\nglass.  There was no label this time with the words `DRINK
    ME,'\r\nbut nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.  `I know\r\nSOMETHING
    interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,\r\n`whenever I eat or drink
    anything; so I'll just see what this\r\nbottle does.  I do hope it'll make me
    grow large again, for\r\nreally I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'\r\n\r\n 
    It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:\r\nbefore she had drunk
    half the bottle, she found her head pressing\r\nagainst the ceiling, and had
    to stoop to save her neck from being\r\nbroken.  She hastily put down the bottle,
    saying to herself\r\n`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As
    it is, I\r\ncan't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so\r\nmuch!'\r\n\r\n 
    Alas! it was too late to wish that!  She went on growing, and\r\ngrowing, and
    very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  in\r\nanother minute there was not
    even room for this, and she tried\r\nthe effect of lying down with one elbow
    against the door, and the\r\nother arm curled round her head.  Still she went
    on growing, and,\r\nas a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and
    one\r\nfoot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,\r\nwhatever
    happens.  What WILL become of me?'\r\n\r\n  Luckily for Alice, the little magic
    bottle had now had its full\r\neffect, and she grew no larger:  still it was
    very uncomfortable,\r\nand, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever
    getting\r\nout of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\r\n\r\n  `It was
    much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one\r\nwasn't always growing
    larger and smaller, and being ordered about\r\nby mice and rabbits.  I almost
    wish I hadn't gone down that\r\nrabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious,
    you know,\r\nthis sort of life!  I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!\r\nWhen
    I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing\r\nnever happened, and
    now here I am in the middle of one!  There\r\nought to be a book written about
    me, that there ought!  And when\r\nI grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up
    now,' she added in a\r\nsorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up
    any more\r\nHERE.'\r\n\r\n  `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any
    older than I\r\nam now?  That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman-\r\n-but
    then--always to have lessons to learn!  Oh, I shouldn't like\r\nTHAT!'\r\n\r\n 
    `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself.  `How can you\r\nlearn lessons
    in here?  Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no\r\nroom at all for any lesson-books!'\r\n\r\n 
    And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,\r\nand making quite
    a conversation of it altogether; but after a few\r\nminutes she heard a voice
    outside, and stopped to listen.\r\n\r\n  `Mary Ann!  Mary Ann!' said the voice. 
    `Fetch me my gloves\r\nthis moment!'  Then came a little pattering of feet on
    the\r\nstairs.  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and\r\nshe
    trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she\r\nwas now about
    a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no\r\nreason to be afraid of
    it.\r\n\r\n  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;\r\nbut,
    as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed\r\nhard against it,
    that attempt proved a failure.  Alice heard it\r\nsay to itself `Then I'll go
    round and get in at the window.'\r\n\r\n  `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and,
    after waiting till she\r\nfancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window,
    she suddenly\r\nspread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.  She did not\r\nget
    hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,\r\nand a crash of
    broken glass, from which she concluded that it was\r\njust possible it had fallen
    into a cucumber-frame, or something\r\nof the sort.\r\n\r\n  Next came an angry
    voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat!  Where are\r\nyou?'  And then a voice she had
    never heard before, `Sure then\r\nI'm here!  Digging for apples, yer honour!'\r\n\r\n 
    `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily.  `Here!\r\nCome and help
    me out of THIS!'  (Sounds of more broken glass.)\r\n\r\n  `Now tell me, Pat,
    what's that in the window?'\r\n\r\n  `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!'  (He pronounced
    it `arrum.')\r\n\r\n  `An arm, you goose!   Who ever saw one that size?  Why,
    it\r\nfills the whole window!'\r\n\r\n  `Sure, it does, yer honour:  but it's
    an arm for all that.'\r\n\r\n  `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: 
    go and take it\r\naway!'\r\n\r\n  There was a long silence after this, and Alice
    could only hear\r\nwhispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer\r\nhonour,
    at all, at all!'  `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at\r\nlast she spread out
    her hand again, and made another snatch in\r\nthe air.  This time there were
    TWO little shrieks, and more\r\nsounds of broken glass.  `What a number of cucumber-frames
    there\r\nmust be!' thought Alice.  `I wonder what they'll do next!  As for\r\npulling
    me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!  I'm sure I\r\ndon't want to stay
    in here any longer!'\r\n\r\n  She waited for some time without hearing anything
    more:  at\r\nlast came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a\r\ngood
    many voice all talking together:  she made out the words:\r\n`Where's the other
    ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;\r\nBill's got the other--Bill! fetch
    it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up\r\nat this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they
    don't reach half\r\nhigh enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular-\r\n-Here,
    Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind\r\nthat loose slate--Oh,
    it's coming down!  Heads below!' (a loud\r\ncrash)--`Now, who did that?--It was
    Bill, I fancy--Who's to go\r\ndown the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That
    I won't,\r\nthen!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to\r\ngo
    down the chimney!'\r\n\r\n  `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has
    he?' said\r\nAlice to herself.  `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!\r\nI
    wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal:  this fireplace is\r\nnarrow, to
    be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'\r\n\r\n  She drew her foot as far
    down the chimney as she could, and\r\nwaited till she heard a little animal (she
    couldn't guess of what\r\nsort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the
    chimney close\r\nabove her:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave
    one\r\nsharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.\r\n\r\n  The first
    thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes\r\nBill!' then the Rabbit's
    voice along--`Catch him, you by the\r\nhedge!' then silence, and then another
    confusion of voices--`Hold\r\nup his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was
    it, old fellow?\r\nWhat happened to you?  Tell us all about it!'\r\n\r\n  Last
    came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'\r\nthought Alice,) `Well,
    I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm\r\nbetter now--but I'm a deal too flustered
    to tell you--all I know\r\nis, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box,
    and up I goes\r\nlike a sky-rocket!'\r\n\r\n  `So you did, old fellow!' said
    the others.\r\n\r\n  `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice;
    and\r\nAlice called out as loud as she could, `If you do.  I'll set\r\nDinah
    at you!'\r\n\r\n  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to\r\nherself,
    `I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any\r\nsense, they'd take the
    roof off.'  After a minute or two, they\r\nbegan moving about again, and Alice
    heard the Rabbit say, `A\r\nbarrowful will do, to begin with.'\r\n\r\n  `A barrowful
    of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to\r\ndoubt, for the next moment
    a shower of little pebbles came\r\nrattling in at the window, and some of them
    hit her in the face.\r\n`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted
    out,\r\n`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all\r\nturning into little
    cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright\r\nidea came into her head.  `If
    I eat one of these cakes,' she\r\nthought, `it's sure to make SOME change in
    my size; and as it\r\ncan't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller,
    I\r\nsuppose.'\r\n\r\n  So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted
    to find\r\nthat she began shrinking directly.  As soon as she was small\r\nenough
    to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and\r\nfound quite a crowd
    of little animals and birds waiting outside.\r\nThe poor little Lizard, Bill,
    was in the middle, being held up by\r\ntwo guinea-pigs, who were giving it something
    out of a bottle.\r\nThey all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but
    she\r\nran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a\r\nthick
    wood.\r\n\r\n  `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she\r\nwandered
    about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;\r\nand the second thing
    is to find my way into that lovely garden.\r\nI think that will be the best plan.'\r\n\r\n 
    It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and\r\nsimply arranged;
    the only difficulty was, that she had not the\r\nsmallest idea how to set about
    it; and while she was peering\r\nabout anxiously among the trees, a little sharp
    bark just over\r\nher head made her look up in a great hurry.\r\n\r\n  An enormous
    puppy was looking down at her with large round\r\neyes, and feebly stretching
    out one paw, trying to touch her.\r\n`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing
    tone, and she tried\r\nhard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened
    all the\r\ntime at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it\r\nwould
    be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\r\n\r\n  Hardly knowing
    what she did, she picked up a little bit of\r\nstick, and held it out to the
    puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped\r\ninto the air off all its feet at once, with
    a yelp of delight,\r\nand rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it;
    then Alice\r\ndodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run\r\nover;
    and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy\r\nmade another rush
    at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in\r\nits hurry to get hold of it;
    then Alice, thinking it was very\r\nlike having a game of play with a cart-horse,
    and expecting every\r\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle\r\nagain;
    then the puppy began a series of short charges at the\r\nstick, running a very
    little way forwards each time and a long\r\nway back, and barking hoarsely all
    the while, till at last it sat\r\ndown a good way off, panting, with its tongue
    hanging out of its\r\nmouth, and its great eyes half shut.\r\n\r\n  This seemed
    to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;\r\nso she set off at once,
    and ran till she was quite tired and out\r\nof breath, and till the puppy's bark
    sounded quite faint in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n  `And yet what a dear little
    puppy it was!' said Alice, as she\r\nleant against a buttercup to rest herself,
    and fanned herself\r\nwith one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching
    it tricks\r\nvery much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!  Oh\r\ndear! 
    I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!  Let\r\nme see--how IS it
    to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or\r\ndrink something or other; but
    the great question is, what?'\r\n\r\n  The great question certainly was, what? 
    Alice looked all round\r\nher at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she
    did not see\r\nanything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under\r\nthe
    circumstances.  There was a large mushroom growing near her,\r\nabout the same
    height as herself; and when she had looked under\r\nit, and on both sides of
    it, and behind it, it occurred to her\r\nthat she might as well look and see
    what was on the top of it.\r\n\r\n  She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped
    over the edge of\r\nthe mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large\r\ncaterpillar,
    that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,\r\nquietly smoking a long hookah,
    and taking not the smallest notice\r\nof her or of anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           
    CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                    Advice from a Caterpillar\r\n\r\n\r\n  The
    Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\r\nsilence:  at last
    the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its\r\nmouth, and addressed her in a languid,
    sleepy voice.\r\n\r\n  `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  This was
    not an encouraging opening for a conversation.  Alice\r\nreplied, rather shyly,
    `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--\r\nat least I know who I WAS when I
    got up this morning, but I think\r\nI must have been changed several times since
    then.'\r\n\r\n  `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.\r\n`Explain
    yourself!'\r\n\r\n  `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because\r\nI'm
    not myself, you see.'\r\n\r\n  `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n 
    `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very\r\npolitely, `for
    I can't understand it myself to begin with; and\r\nbeing so many different sizes
    in a day is very confusing.'\r\n\r\n  `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n 
    `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but\r\nwhen you have
    to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you\r\nknow--and then after that
    into a butterfly, I should think you'll\r\nfeel it a little queer, won't you?'\r\n\r\n 
    `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  `Well, perhaps your feelings may
    be different,' said Alice;\r\n`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'\r\n\r\n 
    `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously.  `Who are YOU?'\r\n\r\n  Which brought
    them back again to the beginning of the\r\nconversation.  Alice felt a little
    irritated at the Caterpillar's\r\nmaking such VERY short remarks, and she drew
    herself up and said,\r\nvery gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU
    are, first.'\r\n\r\n  `Why?' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  Here was another
    puzzling question; and as Alice could not\r\nthink of any good reason, and as
    the Caterpillar seemed to be in\r\na VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned
    away.\r\n\r\n  `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her.  `I've something\r\nimportant
    to say!'\r\n\r\n  This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n 
    `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  `Is that all?' said Alice,
    swallowing down her anger as well as\r\nshe could.\r\n\r\n  `No,' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else\r\nto do, and perhaps
    after all it might tell her something worth\r\nhearing.  For some minutes it
    puffed away without speaking, but\r\nat last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah
    out of its mouth\r\nagain, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'\r\n\r\n 
    `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as\r\nI used--and
    I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'\r\n\r\n  `Can't remember
    WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  `Well, I've tried to say \"HOW DOTH
    THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,\" but it\r\nall came different!' Alice replied in a very
    melancholy voice.\r\n\r\n  `Repeat, \"YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\"' said the
    Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  Alice folded her hands, and began:--\r\n\r\n    `You are
    old, Father William,' the young man said,\r\n      `And your hair has become
    very white;\r\n    And yet you incessantly stand on your head--\r\n      Do you
    think, at your age, it is right?'\r\n\r\n    `In my youth,' Father William replied
    to his son,\r\n      `I feared it might injure the brain;\r\n    But, now that
    I'm perfectly sure I have none,\r\n      Why, I do it again and again.'\r\n\r\n   
    `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,\r\n      And have grown
    most uncommonly fat;\r\n    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--\r\n     
    Pray, what is the reason of that?'\r\n\r\n    `In my youth,' said the sage, as
    he shook his grey locks,\r\n      `I kept all my limbs very supple\r\n    By
    the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--\r\n      Allow me to sell you
    a couple?'\r\n\r\n    `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak\r\n     
    For anything tougher than suet;\r\n    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones
    and the beak--\r\n      Pray how did you manage to do it?'\r\n\r\n    `In my
    youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,\r\n      And argued each case with
    my wife;\r\n    And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\r\n     
    Has lasted the rest of my life.'\r\n\r\n    `You are old,' said the youth, `one
    would hardly suppose\r\n      That your eye was as steady as ever;\r\n    Yet
    you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--\r\n      What made you so awfully
    clever?'\r\n\r\n    `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'\r\n     
    Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!\r\n    Do you think I can listen
    all day to such stuff?\r\n      Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'\r\n\r\n\r\n 
    `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  `Not QUITE right, I'm
    afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the\r\nwords have got altered.'\r\n\r\n 
    `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar\r\ndecidedly, and there
    was silence for some minutes.\r\n\r\n  The Caterpillar was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n 
    `What size do you want to be?' it asked.\r\n\r\n  `Oh, I'm not particular as
    to size,' Alice hastily replied;\r\n`only one doesn't like changing so often,
    you know.'\r\n\r\n  `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  Alice said
    nothing:  she had never been so much contradicted in\r\nher life before, and
    she felt that she was losing her temper.\r\n\r\n  `Are you content now?' said
    the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if
    you\r\nwouldn't mind,' said Alice:  `three inches is such a wretched\r\nheight
    to be.'\r\n\r\n  `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar\r\nangrily,
    rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three\r\ninches high).\r\n\r\n 
    `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.\r\nAnd she thought
    of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so\r\neasily offended!'\r\n\r\n 
    `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it\r\nput the hookah
    into its mouth and began smoking again.\r\n\r\n  This time Alice waited patiently
    until it chose to speak again.\r\nIn a minute or two the Caterpillar took the
    hookah out of its\r\nmouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.  Then
    it got\r\ndown off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely\r\nremarking
    as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and\r\nthe other side will make
    you grow shorter.'\r\n\r\n  `One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT?' thought
    Alice to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n  `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as
    if she had\r\nasked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a\r\nminute, trying to
    make out which were the two sides of it; and as\r\nit was perfectly round, she
    found this a very difficult question.\r\nHowever, at last she stretched her arms
    round it as far as they\r\nwould go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each
    hand.\r\n\r\n  `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a\r\nlittle
    of the right-hand bit to try the effect:  the next moment\r\nshe felt a violent
    blow underneath her chin:  it had struck her\r\nfoot!\r\n\r\n  She was a good
    deal frightened by this very sudden change, but\r\nshe felt that there was no
    time to be lost, as she was shrinking\r\nrapidly; so she set to work at once
    to eat some of the other bit.\r\nHer chin was pressed so closely against her
    foot, that there was\r\nhardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last,
    and\r\nmanaged to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *      
    *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n         *       *       *      
    *       *       *\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *       *      
    *\r\n\r\n  `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of\r\ndelight,
    which changed into alarm in another moment, when she\r\nfound that her shoulders
    were nowhere to be found:  all she could\r\nsee, when she looked down, was an
    immense length of neck, which\r\nseemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of
    green leaves that lay\r\nfar below her.\r\n\r\n  `What CAN all that green stuff
    be?' said Alice.  `And where\r\nHAVE my shoulders got to?  And oh, my poor hands,
    how is it I\r\ncan't see you?'  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no\r\nresult
    seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the\r\ndistant green leaves.\r\n\r\n 
    As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her\r\nhead, she tried
    to get her head down to them, and was delighted\r\nto find that her neck would
    bend about easily in any direction,\r\nlike a serpent.  She had just succeeded
    in curving it down into a\r\ngraceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among
    the leaves, which\r\nshe found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under
    which she\r\nhad been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a\r\nhurry: 
    a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating\r\nher violently with
    its wings.\r\n\r\n  `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.\r\n\r\n  `I'm NOT a serpent!'
    said Alice indignantly.  `Let me alone!'\r\n\r\n  `Serpent, I say again!' repeated
    the Pigeon, but in a more\r\nsubdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've
    tried every\r\nway, and nothing seems to suit them!'\r\n\r\n  `I haven't the
    least idea what you're talking about,' said\r\nAlice.\r\n\r\n  `I've tried the
    roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've\r\ntried hedges,' the Pigeon went
    on, without attending to her; `but\r\nthose serpents!  There's no pleasing them!'\r\n\r\n 
    Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no\r\nuse in saying
    anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\r\n\r\n  `As if it wasn't trouble
    enough hatching the eggs,' said the\r\nPigeon; `but I must be on the look-out
    for serpents night and\r\nday!  Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three
    weeks!'\r\n\r\n  `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was\r\nbeginning
    to see its meaning.\r\n\r\n  `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,'
    continued\r\nthe Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was\r\nthinking
    I should be free of them at last, they must needs come\r\nwriggling down from
    the sky!  Ugh, Serpent!'\r\n\r\n  `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. 
    `I'm a--I'm\r\na--'\r\n\r\n  `Well!  WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon.  `I can
    see you're\r\ntrying to invent something!'\r\n\r\n  `I--I'm a little girl,' said
    Alice, rather doubtfully, as she\r\nremembered the number of changes she had
    gone through that day.\r\n\r\n  `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a
    tone of the\r\ndeepest contempt.  `I've seen a good many little girls in my\r\ntime,
    but never ONE with such a neck as that!  No, no!  You're a\r\nserpent; and there's
    no use denying it.  I suppose you'll be\r\ntelling me next that you never tasted
    an egg!'\r\n\r\n  `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very\r\ntruthful
    child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as\r\nserpents do, you know.'\r\n\r\n 
    `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why\r\nthen they're a
    kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'\r\n\r\n  This was such a new idea to
    Alice, that she was quite silent\r\nfor a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon
    the opportunity of\r\nadding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough;
    and\r\nwhat does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a\r\nserpent?'\r\n\r\n 
    `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm\r\nnot looking for
    eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't\r\nwant YOURS:  I don't like them
    raw.'\r\n\r\n  `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it\r\nsettled
    down again into its nest.  Alice crouched down among the\r\ntrees as well as
    she could, for her neck kept getting entangled\r\namong the branches, and every
    now and then she had to stop and\r\nuntwist it.  After a while she remembered
    that she still held the\r\npieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work
    very\r\ncarefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and\r\ngrowing
    sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\r\nsucceeded in bringing
    herself down to her usual height.\r\n\r\n  It was so long since she had been
    anything near the right size,\r\nthat it felt quite strange at first; but she
    got used to it in a\r\nfew minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. 
    `Come,\r\nthere's half my plan done now!  How puzzling all these changes\r\nare! 
    I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to\r\nanother!  However,
    I've got back to my right size:  the next\r\nthing is, to get into that beautiful
    garden--how IS that to be\r\ndone, I wonder?'  As she said this, she came suddenly
    upon an\r\nopen place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\r\n`Whoever
    lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come\r\nupon them THIS size: 
    why, I should frighten them out of their\r\nwits!'  So she began nibbling at
    the righthand bit again, and did\r\nnot venture to go near the house till she
    had brought herself\r\ndown to nine inches high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          
    CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                         Pig and Pepper\r\n\r\n\r\n  For a
    minute or two she stood looking at the house, and\r\nwondering what to do next,
    when suddenly a footman in livery came\r\nrunning out of the wood--(she considered
    him to be a footman\r\nbecause he was in livery:  otherwise, judging by his face
    only,\r\nshe would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door\r\nwith
    his knuckles.  It was opened by another footman in livery,\r\nwith a round face,
    and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,\r\nAlice noticed, had powdered
    hair that curled all over their\r\nheads.  She felt very curious to know what
    it was all about, and\r\ncrept a little way out of the wood to listen.\r\n\r\n 
    The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great\r\nletter, nearly
    as large as himself, and this he handed over to\r\nthe other, saying, in a solemn
    tone, `For the Duchess.  An\r\ninvitation from the Queen to play croquet.'  The
    Frog-Footman\r\nrepeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of
    the\r\nwords a little, `From the Queen.  An invitation for the Duchess\r\nto
    play croquet.'\r\n\r\n  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into\r\nthe wood for
    fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped\r\nout the Fish-Footman was
    gone, and the other was sitting on the\r\nground near the door, staring stupidly
    up into the sky.\r\n\r\n  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\r\n\r\n 
    `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and\r\nthat for two
    reasons.  First, because I'm on the same side of the\r\ndoor as you are; secondly,
    because they're making such a noise\r\ninside, no one could possibly hear you.' 
    And certainly there was\r\na most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant
    howling\r\nand sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish\r\nor
    kettle had been broken to pieces.\r\n\r\n  `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am
    I to get in?'\r\n\r\n  `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman
    went\r\non without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.  For\r\ninstance,
    if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let\r\nyou out, you know.' 
    He was looking up into the sky all the time\r\nhe was speaking, and this Alice
    thought decidedly uncivil.  `But\r\nperhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself;
    `his eyes are so\r\nVERY nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate he might\r\nanswer
    questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.\r\n\r\n  `I shall sit here,'
    the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'\r\n\r\n  At this moment the door of the
    house opened, and a large plate\r\ncame skimming out, straight at the Footman's
    head:  it just\r\ngrazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees\r\nbehind
    him.\r\n\r\n  `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,\r\nexactly
    as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n  `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again,
    in a louder tone.\r\n\r\n  `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman.  `That's
    the\r\nfirst question, you know.'\r\n\r\n  It was, no doubt:  only Alice did
    not like to be told so.\r\n`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the
    way all the\r\ncreatures argue.  It's enough to drive one crazy!'\r\n\r\n  The
    Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for\r\nrepeating his remark,
    with variations.  `I shall sit here,' he\r\nsaid, `on and off, for days and days.'\r\n\r\n 
    `But what am I to do?' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Anything you like,' said the Footman,
    and began whistling.\r\n\r\n  `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice
    desperately:\r\n`he's perfectly idiotic!'  And she opened the door and went in.\r\n\r\n 
    The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of\r\nsmoke from one
    end to the other:  the Duchess was sitting on a\r\nthree-legged stool in the
    middle, nursing a baby; the cook was\r\nleaning over the fire, stirring a large
    cauldron which seemed to\r\nbe full of soup.\r\n\r\n  `There's certainly too
    much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to\r\nherself, as well as she could for
    sneezing.\r\n\r\n  There was certainly too much of it in the air.  Even the\r\nDuchess
    sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was\r\nsneezing and howling alternately
    without a moment's pause.  The\r\nonly things in the kitchen that did not sneeze,
    were the cook,\r\nand a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning
    from\r\near to ear.\r\n\r\n  `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little
    timidly, for\r\nshe was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to\r\nspeak
    first, `why your cat grins like that?'\r\n\r\n  `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the
    Duchess, `and that's why.\r\nPig!'\r\n\r\n  She said the last word with such
    sudden violence that Alice\r\nquite jumped; but she saw in another moment that
    it was addressed\r\nto the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went
    on\r\nagain:--\r\n\r\n  `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in
    fact, I\r\ndidn't know that cats COULD grin.'\r\n\r\n  `They all can,' said the
    Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'\r\n\r\n  `I don't know of any that do,' Alice
    said very politely,\r\nfeeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.\r\n\r\n 
    `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'\r\n\r\n  Alice
    did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought\r\nit would be as well
    to introduce some other subject of\r\nconversation.  While she was trying to
    fix on one, the cook took\r\nthe cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set
    to work\r\nthrowing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby\r\n--the
    fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,\r\nplates, and dishes. 
    The Duchess took no notice of them even when\r\nthey hit her; and the baby was
    howling so much already, that it\r\nwas quite impossible to say whether the blows
    hurt it or not.\r\n\r\n  `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping
    up\r\nand down in an agony of terror.  `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS\r\nnose';
    as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very\r\nnearly carried it
    off.\r\n\r\n  `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a\r\nhoarse
    growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it\r\ndoes.'\r\n\r\n  `Which
    would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very\r\nglad to get an opportunity
    of showing off a little of her\r\nknowledge.  `Just think of what work it would
    make with the day\r\nand night!  You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to
    turn\r\nround on its axis--'\r\n\r\n  `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop
    off her head!'\r\n\r\n  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if
    she meant\r\nto take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and\r\nseemed
    not to be listening, so she went on again:  `Twenty-four\r\nhours, I THINK; or
    is it twelve?  I--'\r\n\r\n  `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never
    could abide\r\nfigures!'  And with that she began nursing her child again,\r\nsinging
    a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a\r\nviolent shake at the
    end of every line:\r\n\r\n        `Speak roughly to your little boy,\r\n         
    And beat him when he sneezes:\r\n        He only does it to annoy,\r\n         
    Because he knows it teases.'\r\n\r\n                    CHORUS.\r\n\r\n    (In
    which the cook and the baby joined):--\r\n\r\n                `Wow! wow! wow!'\r\n\r\n 
    While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept\r\ntossing the
    baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing\r\nhowled so, that Alice
    could hardly hear the words:--\r\n\r\n        `I speak severely to my boy,\r\n         
    I beat him when he sneezes;\r\n        For he can thoroughly enjoy\r\n         
    The pepper when he pleases!'\r\n\r\n                    CHORUS.\r\n\r\n               
    `Wow! wow! wow!'\r\n\r\n  `Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess
    said\r\nto Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.  `I must go and\r\nget
    ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of\r\nthe room.  The
    cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,\r\nbut it just missed her.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-\r\nshaped little
    creature, and held out its arms and legs in all\r\ndirections, `just like a star-fish,'
    thought Alice.  The poor\r\nlittle thing was snorting like a steam-engine when
    she caught it,\r\nand kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,\r\nso
    that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much\r\nas she could
    do to hold it.\r\n\r\n  As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing
    it,\r\n(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep\r\ntight
    hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its\r\nundoing itself,)
    she carried it out into the open air.  `IF I\r\ndon't take this child away with
    me,' thought Alice, `they're sure\r\nto kill it in a day or two:  wouldn't it
    be murder to leave it\r\nbehind?'  She said the last words out loud, and the
    little thing\r\ngrunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).  `Don't\r\ngrunt,'
    said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing\r\nyourself.'\r\n\r\n 
    The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into\r\nits face to see
    what was the matter with it.  There could be no\r\ndoubt that it had a VERY turn-up
    nose, much more like a snout\r\nthan a real nose; also its eyes were getting
    extremely small for\r\na baby:  altogether Alice did not like the look of the
    thing at\r\nall.  `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked\r\ninto
    its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.\r\n\r\n  No, there were no tears. 
    `If you're going to turn into a pig,\r\nmy dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll
    have nothing more to do\r\nwith you.  Mind now!'  The poor little thing sobbed
    again (or\r\ngrunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for\r\nsome
    while in silence.\r\n\r\n  Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now,
    what am I\r\nto do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted\r\nagain,
    so violently, that she looked down into its face in some\r\nalarm.  This time
    there could be NO mistake about it:  it was\r\nneither more nor less than a pig,
    and she felt that it would be\r\nquite absurd for her to carry it further.\r\n\r\n 
    So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to\r\nsee it trot
    away quietly into the wood.  `If it had grown up,'\r\nshe said to herself, `it
    would have made a dreadfully ugly child:\r\nbut it makes rather a handsome pig,
    I think.'  And she began\r\nthinking over other children she knew, who might
    do very well as\r\npigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the
    right\r\nway to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing\r\nthe
    Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.\r\n\r\n  The Cat only
    grinned when it saw Alice.  It looked good-\r\nnatured, she thought:  still it
    had VERY long claws and a great\r\nmany teeth, so she felt that it ought to be
    treated with respect.\r\n\r\n  `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as
    she did not at\r\nall know whether it would like the name:  however, it only\r\ngrinned
    a little wider.  `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought\r\nAlice, and she went
    on.  `Would you tell me, please, which way I\r\nought to go from here?'\r\n\r\n 
    `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said\r\nthe Cat.\r\n\r\n 
    `I don't much care where--' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Then it doesn't matter which
    way you go,' said the Cat.\r\n\r\n  `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added
    as an explanation.\r\n\r\n  `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you
    only walk\r\nlong enough.'\r\n\r\n  Alice felt that this could not be denied,
    so she tried another\r\nquestion.  `What sort of people live about here?'\r\n\r\n 
    `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,\r\n`lives a Hatter: 
    and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,\r\n`lives a March Hare.  Visit
    either you like:  they're both mad.'\r\n\r\n  `But I don't want to go among mad
    people,' Alice remarked.\r\n\r\n  `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat:  `we're
    all mad here.\r\nI'm mad.  You're mad.'\r\n\r\n  `How do you know I'm mad?' said
    Alice.\r\n\r\n  `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.'\r\n\r\n 
    Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on\r\n`And how do
    you know that you're mad?'\r\n\r\n  `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not
    mad.  You grant\r\nthat?'\r\n\r\n  `I suppose so,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Well,
    then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's\r\nangry, and wags its
    tail when it's pleased.  Now I growl when I'm\r\npleased, and wag my tail when
    I'm angry.  Therefore I'm mad.'\r\n\r\n  `I call it purring, not growling,' said
    Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Call it what you like,' said the Cat.  `Do you play croquet\r\nwith
    the Queen to-day?'\r\n\r\n  `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I
    haven't been\r\ninvited yet.'\r\n\r\n  `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and
    vanished.\r\n\r\n  Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used\r\nto
    queer things happening.  While she was looking at the place\r\nwhere it had been,
    it suddenly appeared again.\r\n\r\n  `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said
    the Cat.  `I'd\r\nnearly forgotten to ask.'\r\n\r\n  `It turned into a pig,'
    Alice quietly said, just as if it had\r\ncome back in a natural way.\r\n\r\n 
    `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.\r\n\r\n  Alice waited
    a little, half expecting to see it again, but it\r\ndid not appear, and after
    a minute or two she walked on in the\r\ndirection in which the March Hare was
    said to live.  `I've seen\r\nhatters before,' she said to herself; `the March
    Hare will be\r\nmuch the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't
    be\r\nraving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.'  As she said\r\nthis,
    she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a\r\nbranch of a tree.\r\n\r\n 
    `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.\r\n\r\n  `I said pig,' replied Alice;
    `and I wish you wouldn't keep\r\nappearing and vanishing so suddenly:  you make
    one quite giddy.'\r\n\r\n  `All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished
    quite\r\nslowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the\r\ngrin,
    which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.\r\n\r\n  `Well!  I've
    often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;\r\n`but a grin without a cat! 
    It's the most curious thing I ever\r\nsay in my life!'\r\n\r\n  She had not gone
    much farther before she came in sight of the\r\nhouse of the March Hare:  she
    thought it must be the right house,\r\nbecause the chimneys were shaped like
    ears and the roof was\r\nthatched with fur.  It was so large a house, that she
    did not\r\nlike to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand\r\nbit
    of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high:  even\r\nthen she walked
    up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself\r\n`Suppose it should be raving
    mad after all!  I almost wish I'd\r\ngone to see the Hatter instead!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          
    CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                         A Mad Tea-Party\r\n\r\n\r\n  There
    was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,\r\nand the March Hare
    and the Hatter were having tea at it:  a\r\nDormouse was sitting between them,
    fast asleep, and the other two\r\nwere using it as a cushion, resting their elbows
    on it, and the\r\ntalking over its head.  `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,'\r\nthought
    Alice; `only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'\r\n\r\n  The table
    was a large one, but the three were all crowded\r\ntogether at one corner of
    it:  `No room!  No room!' they cried\r\nout when they saw Alice coming.  `There's
    PLENTY of room!' said\r\nAlice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair
    at one\r\nend of the table.\r\n\r\n  `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in
    an encouraging tone.\r\n\r\n  Alice looked all round the table, but there was
    nothing on it\r\nbut tea.  `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.\r\n\r\n  `There
    isn't any,' said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n  `Then it wasn't very civil of you to
    offer it,' said Alice\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\n  `It wasn't very civil of you to sit
    down without being\r\ninvited,' said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n  `I didn't know
    it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a\r\ngreat many more than three.'\r\n\r\n 
    `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter.  He had been\r\nlooking at Alice
    for some time with great curiosity, and this was\r\nhis first speech.\r\n\r\n 
    `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said\r\nwith some severity;
    `it's very rude.'\r\n\r\n  The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this;
    but all\r\nhe SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'\r\n\r\n  `Come,
    we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice.  `I'm glad\r\nthey've begun asking
    riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she\r\nadded aloud.\r\n\r\n  `Do you mean
    that you think you can find out the answer to it?'\r\nsaid the March Hare.\r\n\r\n 
    `Exactly so,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Then you should say what you mean,' the March
    Hare went on.\r\n\r\n  `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean
    what\r\nI say--that's the same thing, you know.'\r\n\r\n  `Not the same thing
    a bit!' said the Hatter.  `You might just\r\nas well say that \"I see what I
    eat\" is the same thing as \"I eat\r\nwhat I see\"!'\r\n\r\n  `You might just
    as well say,' added the March Hare, `that \"I\r\nlike what I get\" is the same
    thing as \"I get what I like\"!'\r\n\r\n  `You might just as well say,' added
    the Dormouse, who seemed to\r\nbe talking in his sleep, `that \"I breathe when
    I sleep\" is the\r\nsame thing as \"I sleep when I breathe\"!'\r\n\r\n  `It IS
    the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the\r\nconversation dropped,
    and the party sat silent for a minute,\r\nwhile Alice thought over all she could
    remember about ravens and\r\nwriting-desks, which wasn't much.\r\n\r\n  The Hatter
    was the first to break the silence.  `What day of\r\nthe month is it?' he said,
    turning to Alice:  he had taken his\r\nwatch out of his pocket, and was looking
    at it uneasily, shaking\r\nit every now and then, and holding it to his ear.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'\r\n\r\n  `Two days wrong!'
    sighed the Hatter.  `I told you butter\r\nwouldn't suit the works!' he added
    looking angrily at the March\r\nHare.\r\n\r\n  `It was the BEST butter,' the
    March Hare meekly replied.\r\n\r\n  `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as
    well,' the Hatter\r\ngrumbled:  `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'\r\n\r\n 
    The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily:  then\r\nhe dipped it
    into his cup of tea, and looked at it again:  but he\r\ncould think of nothing
    better to say than his first remark, `It\r\nwas the BEST butter, you know.'\r\n\r\n 
    Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.\r\n`What a funny
    watch!' she remarked.  `It tells the day of the\r\nmonth, and doesn't tell what
    o'clock it is!'\r\n\r\n  `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter.  `Does YOUR watch
    tell\r\nyou what year it is?'\r\n\r\n  `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 
    `but that's\r\nbecause it stays the same year for such a long time together.'\r\n\r\n 
    `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.\r\n\r\n  Alice felt dreadfully
    puzzled.  The Hatter's remark seemed to\r\nhave no sort of meaning in it, and
    yet it was certainly English.\r\n`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as
    politely as she\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n  `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter,
    and he poured\r\na little hot tea upon its nose.\r\n\r\n  The Dormouse shook
    its head impatiently, and said, without\r\nopening its eyes, `Of course, of course;
    just what I was going to\r\nremark myself.'\r\n\r\n  `Have you guessed the riddle
    yet?' the Hatter said, turning to\r\nAlice again.\r\n\r\n  `No, I give it up,'
    Alice replied:  `what's the answer?'\r\n\r\n  `I haven't the slightest idea,'
    said the Hatter.\r\n\r\n  `Nor I,' said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n  Alice sighed
    wearily.  `I think you might do something better\r\nwith the time,' she said,
    `than waste it in asking riddles that\r\nhave no answers.'\r\n\r\n  `If you knew
    Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you\r\nwouldn't talk about wasting IT. 
    It's HIM.'\r\n\r\n  `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Of course
    you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head\r\ncontemptuously.  `I dare say
    you never even spoke to Time!'\r\n\r\n  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 
    `but I know I have to\r\nbeat time when I learn music.'\r\n\r\n  `Ah! that accounts
    for it,' said the Hatter.  `He won't stand\r\nbeating.  Now, if you only kept
    on good terms with him, he'd do\r\nalmost anything you liked with the clock. 
    For instance, suppose\r\nit were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin
    lessons:\r\nyou'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the\r\nclock
    in a twinkling!  Half-past one, time for dinner!'\r\n\r\n  (`I only wish it was,'
    the March Hare said to itself in a\r\nwhisper.)\r\n\r\n  `That would be grand,
    certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:\r\n`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for
    it, you know.'\r\n\r\n  `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter:  `but you could
    keep\r\nit to half-past one as long as you liked.'\r\n\r\n  `Is that the way
    YOU manage?' Alice asked.\r\n\r\n  The Hatter shook his head mournfully.  `Not
    I!' he replied.\r\n`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'\r\n(pointing
    with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the\r\ngreat concert given
    by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\r\n\r\n            \"Twinkle, twinkle,
    little bat!\r\n            How I wonder what you're at!\"\r\n\r\nYou know the
    song, perhaps?'\r\n\r\n  `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n 
    `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--\r\n\r\n           
    \"Up above the world you fly,\r\n            Like a tea-tray in the sky.\r\n                   
    Twinkle, twinkle--\"'\r\n\r\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing
    in its sleep\r\n`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that\r\nthey
    had to pinch it to make it stop.\r\n\r\n  `Well, I'd hardly finished the first
    verse,' said the Hatter,\r\n`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, \"He's
    murdering the\r\ntime!  Off with his head!\"'\r\n\r\n  `How dreadfully savage!'
    exclaimed Alice.\r\n\r\n  `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful
    tone,\r\n`he won't do a thing I ask!  It's always six o'clock now.'\r\n\r\n 
    A bright idea came into Alice's head.  `Is that the reason so\r\nmany tea-things
    are put out here?' she asked.\r\n\r\n  `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with
    a sigh:  `it's always\r\ntea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between
    whiles.'\r\n\r\n  `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.\r\n\r\n 
    `Exactly so,' said the Hatter:  `as the things get used up.'\r\n\r\n  `But what
    happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice\r\nventured to ask.\r\n\r\n 
    `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,\r\nyawning.  `I'm
    getting tired of this.  I vote the young lady\r\ntells us a story.'\r\n\r\n 
    `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at\r\nthe proposal.\r\n\r\n 
    `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.  `Wake up,\r\nDormouse!'  And they
    pinched it on both sides at once.\r\n\r\n  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 
    `I wasn't asleep,' he\r\nsaid in a hoarse, feeble voice:  `I heard every word
    you fellows\r\nwere saying.'\r\n\r\n  `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n 
    `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.\r\n\r\n  `And be quick about it,' added the
    Hatter, `or you'll be asleep\r\nagain before it's done.'\r\n\r\n  `Once upon
    a time there were three little sisters,' the\r\nDormouse began in a great hurry;
    `and their names were Elsie,\r\nLacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom
    of a well--'\r\n\r\n  `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a
    great\r\ninterest in questions of eating and drinking.\r\n\r\n  `They lived on
    treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a\r\nminute or two.\r\n\r\n  `They
    couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently\r\nremarked; `they'd have been
    ill.'\r\n\r\n  `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'\r\n\r\n  Alice
    tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways\r\nof living would
    be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went\r\non:  `But why did they live
    at the bottom of a well?'\r\n\r\n  `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said
    to Alice, very\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\n  `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in
    an offended tone, `so\r\nI can't take more.'\r\n\r\n  `You mean you can't take
    LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very\r\neasy to take MORE than nothing.'\r\n\r\n 
    `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Who's making personal remarks
    now?' the Hatter asked\r\ntriumphantly.\r\n\r\n  Alice did not quite know what
    to say to this:  so she helped\r\nherself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and
    then turned to the\r\nDormouse, and repeated her question.  `Why did they live
    at the\r\nbottom of a well?'\r\n\r\n  The Dormouse again took a minute or two
    to think about it, and\r\nthen said, `It was a treacle-well.'\r\n\r\n  `There's
    no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but\r\nthe Hatter and the
    March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse\r\nsulkily remarked, `If you can't
    be civil, you'd better finish the\r\nstory for yourself.'\r\n\r\n  `No, please
    go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt\r\nagain.  I dare say there
    may be ONE.'\r\n\r\n  `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.  However,
    he\r\nconsented to go on.  `And so these three little sisters--they\r\nwere learning
    to draw, you know--'\r\n\r\n  `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting
    her promise.\r\n\r\n  `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all
    this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n  `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter:  `let's
    all move\r\none place on.'\r\n\r\n  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse
    followed him:  the\r\nMarch Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather\r\nunwillingly
    took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the\r\nonly one who got any
    advantage from the change:  and Alice was a\r\ngood deal worse off than before,
    as the March Hare had just upset\r\nthe milk-jug into his plate.\r\n\r\n  Alice
    did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began\r\nvery cautiously: 
    `But I don't understand.  Where did they draw\r\nthe treacle from?'\r\n\r\n 
    `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so\r\nI should think
    you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,\r\nstupid?'\r\n\r\n  `But they
    were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not\r\nchoosing to notice this
    last remark.\r\n\r\n  `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'\r\n\r\n 
    This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse\r\ngo on for some
    time without interrupting it.\r\n\r\n  `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse
    went on, yawning and\r\nrubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and
    they drew\r\nall manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'\r\n\r\n 
    `Why with an M?' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Why not?' said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice was silent.\r\n\r\n  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and
    was going\r\noff into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up\r\nagain
    with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an\r\nM, such as mouse-traps,
    and the moon, and memory, and muchness--\r\nyou know you say things are \"much
    of a muchness\"--did you ever\r\nsee such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'\r\n\r\n 
    `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I\r\ndon't think--'\r\n\r\n 
    `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.\r\n\r\n  This piece of rudeness was
    more than Alice could bear:  she got\r\nup in great disgust, and walked off;
    the Dormouse fell asleep\r\ninstantly, and neither of the others took the least
    notice of her\r\ngoing, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that\r\nthey
    would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were\r\ntrying to put
    the Dormouse into the teapot.\r\n\r\n  `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!'
    said Alice as she\r\npicked her way through the wood.  `It's the stupidest tea-party
    I\r\never was at in all my life!'\r\n\r\n  Just as she said this, she noticed
    that one of the trees had a\r\ndoor leading right into it.  `That's very curious!'
    she thought.\r\n`But everything's curious today.  I think I may as well go in
    at\r\nonce.'  And in she went.\r\n\r\n  Once more she found herself in the long
    hall, and close to the\r\nlittle glass table.  `Now, I'll manage better this
    time,' she\r\nsaid to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and\r\nunlocking
    the door that led into the garden.  Then she went to\r\nwork nibbling at the
    mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her\r\npocked) till she was about a foot
    high:  then she walked down the\r\nlittle passage:  and THEN--she found herself
    at last in the\r\nbeautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool\r\nfountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         
    CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                   The Queen's Croquet-Ground\r\n\r\n\r\n 
    A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:  the\r\nroses growing
    on it were white, but there were three gardeners at\r\nit, busily painting them
    red.  Alice thought this a very curious\r\nthing, and she went nearer to watch
    them, and just as she came up\r\nto them she heard one of them say, `Look out
    now, Five!  Don't go\r\nsplashing paint over me like that!'\r\n\r\n  `I couldn't
    help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged\r\nmy elbow.'\r\n\r\n  On
    which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five!  Always\r\nlay the blame
    on others!'\r\n\r\n  `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five.  `I heard the Queen
    say only\r\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'\r\n\r\n  `What for?' said
    the one who had spoken first.\r\n\r\n  `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said
    Seven.\r\n\r\n  `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it\r\nwas
    for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'\r\n\r\n  Seven flung down
    his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all\r\nthe unjust things--' when his
    eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as\r\nshe stood watching them, and he checked
    himself suddenly:  the\r\nothers looked round also, and all of them bowed low.\r\n\r\n 
    `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are\r\npainting those
    roses?'\r\n\r\n  Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.  Two began in
    a\r\nlow voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to\r\nhave been
    a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;\r\nand if the Queen was
    to find it out, we should all have our heads\r\ncut off, you know.  So you see,
    Miss, we're doing our best, afore\r\nshe comes, to--'  At this moment Five, who
    had been anxiously\r\nlooking across the garden, called out `The Queen!  The
    Queen!'\r\nand the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon\r\ntheir
    faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice\r\nlooked round, eager
    to see the Queen.\r\n\r\n  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were
    all shaped\r\nlike the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and\r\nfeet
    at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were\r\nornamented all over with
    diamonds, and walked two and two, as the\r\nsoldiers did.  After these came the
    royal children; there were\r\nten of them, and the little dears came jumping
    merrily along hand\r\nin hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts. 
    Next\r\ncame the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice\r\nrecognised
    the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous\r\nmanner, smiling at
    everything that was said, and went by without\r\nnoticing her.  Then followed
    the Knave of Hearts, carrying the\r\nKing's crown on a crimson velvet cushion;
    and, last of all this\r\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on\r\nher face like
    the three gardeners, but she could not remember\r\nevery having heard of such
    a rule at processions; `and besides,\r\nwhat would be the use of a procession,'
    thought she, `if people\r\nhad all to lie down upon their faces, so that they
    couldn't see\r\nit?'  So she stood still where she was, and waited.\r\n\r\n 
    When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped\r\nand looked at
    her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'\r\nShe said it to the Knave of
    Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n  `Idiot!' said the Queen,
    tossing her head impatiently; and,\r\nturning to Alice, she went on, `What's
    your name, child?'\r\n\r\n  `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said
    Alice very\r\npolitely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack
    of\r\ncards, after all.  I needn't be afraid of them!'\r\n\r\n  `And who are
    THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three\r\ngardeners who were lying round
    the rosetree; for, you see, as\r\nthey were lying on their faces, and the pattern
    on their backs\r\nwas the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether\r\nthey
    were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her\r\nown children.\r\n\r\n 
    `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.\r\n`It's no business
    of MINE.'\r\n\r\n  The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at
    her\r\nfor a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!\r\nOff--'\r\n\r\n 
    `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the\r\nQueen was silent.\r\n\r\n 
    The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said\r\n`Consider, my dear: 
    she is only a child!'\r\n\r\n  The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said
    to the Knave\r\n`Turn them over!'\r\n\r\n  The Knave did so, very carefully,
    with one foot.\r\n\r\n  `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and
    the\r\nthree gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the\r\nKing,
    the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.\r\n\r\n  `Leave off that!'
    screamed the Queen.  `You make me giddy.'\r\nAnd then, turning to the rose-tree,
    she went on, `What HAVE you\r\nbeen doing here?'\r\n\r\n  `May it please your
    Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,\r\ngoing down on one knee as he spoke,
    `we were trying--'\r\n\r\n  `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining
    the\r\nroses.  `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,\r\nthree
    of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate\r\ngardeners, who
    ran to Alice for protection.\r\n\r\n  `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and
    she put them into a\r\nlarge flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers
    wandered\r\nabout for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly\r\nmarched
    off after the others.\r\n\r\n  `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.\r\n\r\n 
    `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers\r\nshouted in
    reply.\r\n\r\n  `That's right!' shouted the Queen.  `Can you play croquet?'\r\n\r\n 
    The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question\r\nwas evidently
    meant for her.\r\n\r\n  `Yes!' shouted Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Come on, then!' roared
    the Queen, and Alice joined the\r\nprocession, wondering very much what would
    happen next.\r\n\r\n  `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her
    side.\r\nShe was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously\r\ninto
    her face.\r\n\r\n  `Very,' said Alice:  `--where's the Duchess?'\r\n\r\n  `Hush! 
    Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  He\r\nlooked anxiously over his
    shoulder as he spoke, and then raised\r\nhimself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close
    to her ear, and\r\nwhispered `She's under sentence of execution.'\r\n\r\n  `What
    for?' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Did you say \"What a pity!\"?' the Rabbit asked.\r\n\r\n 
    `No, I didn't,' said Alice:  `I don't think it's at all a pity.\r\nI said \"What
    for?\"'\r\n\r\n  `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.  Alice gave
    a\r\nlittle scream of laughter.  `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a\r\nfrightened
    tone.  `The Queen will hear you!  You see, she came\r\nrather late, and the Queen
    said--'\r\n\r\n  `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,\r\nand
    people began running about in all directions, tumbling up\r\nagainst each other;
    however, they got settled down in a minute or\r\ntwo, and the game began.  Alice
    thought she had never seen such a\r\ncurious croquet-ground in her life; it was
    all ridges and\r\nfurrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live\r\nflamingoes,
    and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to\r\nstand on their hands and
    feet, to make the arches.\r\n\r\n  The chief difficulty Alice found at first
    was in managing her\r\nflamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,\r\ncomfortably
    enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,\r\nbut generally, just as
    she had got its neck nicely straightened\r\nout, and was going to give the hedgehog
    a blow with its head, it\r\nWOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,
    with such a\r\npuzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:\r\nand
    when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,\r\nit was very
    provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\r\nitself, and was in the act
    of crawling away:  besides all this,\r\nthere was generally a ridge or furrow
    in the way wherever she\r\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up
    soldiers\r\nwere always getting up and walking off to other parts of the\r\nground,
    Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very\r\ndifficult game indeed.\r\n\r\n 
    The players all played at once without waiting for turns,\r\nquarrelling all
    the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in\r\na very short time the Queen
    was in a furious passion, and went\r\nstamping about, and shouting `Off with
    his head!' or `Off with\r\nher head!' about once in a minute.\r\n\r\n  Alice
    began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not as\r\nyet had any dispute
    with the Queen, but she knew that it might\r\nhappen any minute, `and then,'
    thought she, `what would become of\r\nme?  They're dreadfully fond of beheading
    people here; the great\r\nwonder is, that there's any one left alive!'\r\n\r\n 
    She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering\r\nwhether she could
    get away without being seen, when she noticed a\r\ncurious appearance in the
    air:  it puzzled her very much at\r\nfirst, but, after watching it a minute or
    two, she made it out to\r\nbe a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire
    Cat:  now I\r\nshall have somebody to talk to.'\r\n\r\n  `How are you getting
    on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was\r\nmouth enough for it to speak with.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.  `It's no\r\nuse speaking
    to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at\r\nleast one of them.' 
    In another minute the whole head appeared,\r\nand then Alice put down her flamingo,
    and began an account of the\r\ngame, feeling very glad she had someone to listen
    to her.  The\r\nCat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight,
    and\r\nno more of it appeared.\r\n\r\n  `I don't think they play at all fairly,'
    Alice began, in rather\r\na complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully
    one can't\r\nhear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in\r\nparticular;
    at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and\r\nyou've no idea how confusing
    it is all the things being alive;\r\nfor instance, there's the arch I've got
    to go through next\r\nwalking about at the other end of the ground--and I should
    have\r\ncroqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it\r\nsaw
    mine coming!'\r\n\r\n  `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.\r\n\r\n 
    `Not at all,' said Alice:  `she's so extremely--'  Just then\r\nshe noticed that
    the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so\r\nshe went on, `--likely to win,
    that it's hardly worth while\r\nfinishing the game.'\r\n\r\n  The Queen smiled
    and passed on.\r\n\r\n  `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to
    Alice, and\r\nlooking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.\r\n\r\n  `It's
    a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me\r\nto introduce it.'\r\n\r\n 
    `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:  `however,\r\nit may kiss
    my hand if it likes.'\r\n\r\n  `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.\r\n\r\n  `Don't
    be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me\r\nlike that!'  He got
    behind Alice as he spoke.\r\n\r\n  `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.  `I've
    read that in\r\nsome book, but I don't remember where.'\r\n\r\n  `Well, it must
    be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and\r\nhe called the Queen, who was
    passing at the moment, `My dear!  I\r\nwish you would have this cat removed!'\r\n\r\n 
    The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great\r\nor small. 
    `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking\r\nround.\r\n\r\n  `I'll
    fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and\r\nhe hurried off.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game\r\nwas going on,
    as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,\r\nscreaming with passion.  She
    had already heard her sentence three\r\nof the players to be executed for having
    missed their turns, and\r\nshe did not like the look of things at all, as the
    game was in\r\nsuch confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or\r\nnot. 
    So she went in search of her hedgehog.\r\n\r\n  The hedgehog was engaged in a
    fight with another hedgehog,\r\nwhich seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity
    for croqueting one\r\nof them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that
    her\r\nflamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where\r\nAlice
    could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up\r\ninto a tree.\r\n\r\n 
    By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,\r\nthe fight was
    over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:\r\n`but it doesn't matter much,'
    thought Alice, `as all the arches\r\nare gone from this side of the ground.' 
    So she tucked it away\r\nunder her arm, that it might not escape again, and went
    back for\r\na little more conversation with her friend.\r\n\r\n  When she got
    back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to\r\nfind quite a large crowd collected
    round it:  there was a dispute\r\ngoing on between the executioner, the King,
    and the Queen, who\r\nwere all talking at once, while all the rest were quite
    silent,\r\nand looked very uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n  The moment Alice appeared,
    she was appealed to by all three to\r\nsettle the question, and they repeated
    their arguments to her,\r\nthough, as they all spoke at once, she found it very
    hard indeed\r\nto make out exactly what they said.\r\n\r\n  The executioner's
    argument was, that you couldn't cut off a\r\nhead unless there was a body to
    cut it off from:  that he had\r\nnever had to do such a thing before, and he
    wasn't going to begin\r\nat HIS time of life.\r\n\r\n  The King's argument was,
    that anything that had a head could be\r\nbeheaded, and that you weren't to talk
    nonsense.\r\n\r\n  The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about\r\nit
    in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.\r\n(It was this
    last remark that had made the whole party look so\r\ngrave and anxious.)\r\n\r\n 
    Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the\r\nDuchess: 
    you'd better ask HER about it.'\r\n\r\n  `She's in prison,' the Queen said to
    the executioner:  `fetch\r\nher here.'  And the executioner went off like an
    arrow.\r\n\r\n   The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,\r\nby
    the time he had come back with the Dutchess, it had entirely\r\ndisappeared;
    so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and\r\ndown looking for it, while
    the rest of the party went back to the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          
    CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                     The Mock Turtle's Story\r\n\r\n\r\n  `You
    can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old\r\nthing!' said the
    Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately\r\ninto Alice's, and they walked
    off together.\r\n\r\n  Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper,
    and\r\nthought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had\r\nmade
    her so savage when they met in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n  `When I'M a Duchess,' she
    said to herself, (not in a very\r\nhopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper
    in my kitchen AT\r\nALL.  Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper
    that\r\nmakes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at\r\nhaving
    found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them\r\nsour--and camomile
    that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar\r\nand such things that make children
    sweet-tempered.  I only wish\r\npeople knew that:  then they wouldn't be so stingy
    about it, you\r\nknow--'\r\n\r\n  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this
    time, and was a\r\nlittle startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.\r\n`You're
    thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you\r\nforget to talk.  I can't
    tell you just now what the moral of that\r\nis, but I shall remember it in a
    bit.'\r\n\r\n  `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.\r\n\r\n  `Tut,
    tut, child!' said the Duchess.  `Everything's got a\r\nmoral, if only you can
    find it.'  And she squeezed herself up\r\ncloser to Alice's side as she spoke.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice did not much like keeping so close to her:  first,\r\nbecause the Duchess
    was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was\r\nexactly the right height to rest
    her chin upon Alice's shoulder,\r\nand it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.  However,
    she did not\r\nlike to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.\r\n\r\n 
    `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of\r\nkeeping up the
    conversation a little.\r\n\r\n  `'Tis so,' said the Duchess:  `and the moral
    of that is--\"Oh,\r\n'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!\"'\r\n\r\n 
    `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody\r\nminding their
    own business!'\r\n\r\n  `Ah, well!  It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,\r\ndigging
    her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,\r\n`and the moral of
    THAT is--\"Take care of the sense, and the\r\nsounds will take care of themselves.\"'\r\n\r\n 
    `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n 
    `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your\r\nwaist,' the
    Duchess said after a pause:  `the reason is, that I'm\r\ndoubtful about the temper
    of your flamingo.  Shall I try the\r\nexperiment?'\r\n\r\n  `HE might bite,'
    Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all\r\nanxious to have the experiment
    tried.\r\n\r\n  `Very true,' said the Duchess:  `flamingoes and mustard both\r\nbite. 
    And the moral of that is--\"Birds of a feather flock\r\ntogether.\"'\r\n\r\n 
    `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.\r\n\r\n  `Right, as usual,' said
    the Duchess:  `what a clear way you\r\nhave of putting things!'\r\n\r\n  `It's
    a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Of course it is,' said the Duchess,
    who seemed ready to agree\r\nto everything that Alice said; `there's a large
    mustard-mine near\r\nhere.  And the moral of that is--\"The more there is of
    mine, the\r\nless there is of yours.\"'\r\n\r\n  `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice,
    who had not attended to this\r\nlast remark, `it's a vegetable.  It doesn't look
    like one, but it\r\nis.'\r\n\r\n  `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess;
    `and the moral of\r\nthat is--\"Be what you would seem to be\"--or if you'd like
    it put\r\nmore simply--\"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than\r\nwhat
    it might appear to others that what you were or might have\r\nbeen was not otherwise
    than what you had been would have appeared\r\nto them to be otherwise.\"'\r\n\r\n 
    `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very\r\npolitely, `if I
    had it written down:  but I can't quite follow it\r\nas you say it.'\r\n\r\n 
    `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess\r\nreplied, in a
    pleased tone.\r\n\r\n  `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than
    that,'\r\nsaid Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. 
    `I make you\r\na present of everything I've said as yet.'\r\n\r\n  `A cheap sort
    of present!' thought Alice.  `I'm glad they don't\r\ngive birthday presents like
    that!'  But she did not venture to\r\nsay it out loud.\r\n\r\n  `Thinking again?'
    the Duchess asked, with another dig of her\r\nsharp little chin.\r\n\r\n  `I've
    a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was\r\nbeginning to feel a little
    worried.\r\n\r\n  `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have
    to\r\nfly; and the m--'\r\n\r\n  But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's
    voice died\r\naway, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the\r\narm
    that was linked into hers began to tremble.  Alice looked up,\r\nand there stood
    the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,\r\nfrowning like a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\n 
    `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n 
    `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on\r\nthe ground
    as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,\r\nand that in about half
    no time!  Take your choice!'\r\n\r\n  The Duchess took her choice, and was gone
    in a moment.\r\n\r\n  `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and
    Alice\r\nwas too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her\r\nback
    to the croquet-ground.\r\n\r\n  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's
    absence,\r\nand were resting in the shade:  however, the moment they saw her,\r\nthey
    hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a\r\nmoment's delay
    would cost them their lives.\r\n\r\n  All the time they were playing the Queen
    never left off\r\nquarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with
    his\r\nhead!' or `Off with her head!'  Those whom she sentenced were\r\ntaken
    into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave\r\noff being arches
    to do this, so that by the end of half an hour\r\nor so there were no arches
    left, and all the players, except the\r\nKing, the Queen, and Alice, were in
    custody and under sentence of\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n  Then the Queen left off,
    quite out of breath, and said to\r\nAlice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'\r\n\r\n 
    `No,' said Alice.  `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'\r\n\r\n  `It's
    the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.\r\n\r\n  `I never saw
    one, or heard of one,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Come on, then,' said the Queen,
    `and he shall tell you his\r\nhistory,'\r\n\r\n  As they walked off together,
    Alice heard the King say in a low\r\nvoice, to the company generally, `You are
    all pardoned.'  `Come,\r\nTHAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she
    had felt quite\r\nunhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.\r\n\r\n 
    They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the\r\nsun.  (IF you
    don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)\r\n`Up, lazy thing!' said
    the Queen, `and take this young lady to\r\nsee the Mock Turtle, and to hear his
    history.  I must go back and\r\nsee after some executions I have ordered'; and
    she walked off,\r\nleaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.  Alice did not quite
    like\r\nthe look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would\r\nbe
    quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage\r\nQueen:  so she waited.\r\n\r\n 
    The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the\r\nQueen till she
    was out of sight:  then it chuckled.  `What fun!'\r\nsaid the Gryphon, half to
    itself, half to Alice.\r\n\r\n  `What IS the fun?' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Why,
    SHE,' said the Gryphon.  `It's all her fancy, that:  they\r\nnever executes nobody,
    you know.  Come on!'\r\n\r\n  `Everybody says \"come on!\" here,' thought Alice,
    as she went\r\nslowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life,\r\nnever!'\r\n\r\n 
    They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the\r\ndistance, sitting
    sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,\r\nas they came nearer, Alice
    could hear him sighing as if his heart\r\nwould break.  She pitied him deeply. 
    `What is his sorrow?' she\r\nasked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very
    nearly in the\r\nsame words as before, `It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't
    got\r\nno sorrow, you know.  Come on!'\r\n\r\n  So they went up to the Mock Turtle,
    who looked at them with\r\nlarge eyes full of tears, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n 
    `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to\r\nknow your history,
    she do.'\r\n\r\n  `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow\r\ntone: 
    `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've\r\nfinished.'\r\n\r\n 
    So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice\r\nthought to herself,
    `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he\r\ndoesn't begin.'  But she waited
    patiently.\r\n\r\n  `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I
    was\r\na real Turtle.'\r\n\r\n  These words were followed by a very long silence,
    broken only\r\nby an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and\r\nthe
    constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very\r\nnearly getting
    up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your\r\ninteresting story,' but she could
    not help thinking there MUST be\r\nmore to come, so she sat still and said nothing.\r\n\r\n 
    `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more\r\ncalmly, though
    still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to\r\nschool in the sea.  The master
    was an old Turtle--we used to call\r\nhim Tortoise--'\r\n\r\n  `Why did you call
    him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.\r\n\r\n  `We called him Tortoise
    because he taught us,' said the Mock\r\nTurtle angrily:  `really you are very
    dull!'\r\n\r\n  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\r\nquestion,'
    added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and\r\nlooked at poor Alice,
    who felt ready to sink into the earth.  At\r\nlast the Gryphon said to the Mock
    Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!\r\nDon't be all day about it!' and he went on
    in these words:\r\n\r\n  `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't
    believe\r\nit--'\r\n\r\n  `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.\r\n\r\n 
    `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n  `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon,
    before Alice could speak\r\nagain.  The Mock Turtle went on.\r\n\r\n  `We had
    the best of educations--in fact, we went to school\r\nevery day--'\r\n\r\n  `I'VE
    been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be\r\nso proud as all that.'\r\n\r\n 
    `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\r\n\r\n  `Yes,' said
    Alice, `we learned French and music.'\r\n\r\n  `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n 
    `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.\r\n\r\n  `Ah! then yours wasn't a really
    good school,' said the Mock\r\nTurtle in a tone of great relief.  `Now at OURS
    they had at the\r\nend of the bill, \"French, music, AND WASHING--extra.\"'\r\n\r\n 
    `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the\r\nbottom of the
    sea.'\r\n\r\n  `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a\r\nsigh. 
    `I only took the regular course.'\r\n\r\n  `What was that?' inquired Alice.\r\n\r\n 
    `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock\r\nTurtle replied;
    `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--\r\nAmbition, Distraction, Uglification,
    and Derision.'\r\n\r\n  `I never heard of \"Uglification,\"' Alice ventured to
    say.  `What\r\nis it?'\r\n\r\n  The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 
    `What!  Never\r\nheard of uglifying!' it exclaimed.  `You know what to beautify\r\nis,
    I suppose?'\r\n\r\n  `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully:  `it means--to--make--anything--\r\nprettier.'\r\n\r\n 
    `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to\r\nuglify is, you
    ARE a simpleton.'\r\n\r\n  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions
    about\r\nit, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you\r\nto
    learn?'\r\n\r\n  `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting\r\noff
    the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,\r\nwith Seaography: 
    then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old\r\nconger-eel, that used to come
    once a week:  HE taught us\r\nDrawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'\r\n\r\n 
    `What was THAT like?' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Well, I can't show it you myself,'
    the Mock Turtle said:  `I'm\r\ntoo stiff.  And the Gryphon never learnt it.'\r\n\r\n 
    `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon:  `I went to the Classics\r\nmaster, though. 
    He was an old crab, HE was.'\r\n\r\n  `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle
    said with a sigh:  `he\r\ntaught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'\r\n\r\n 
    `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;\r\nand both creatures
    hid their faces in their paws.\r\n\r\n  `And how many hours a day did you do
    lessons?' said Alice, in a\r\nhurry to change the subject.\r\n\r\n  `Ten hours
    the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the\r\nnext, and so on.'\r\n\r\n 
    `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.\r\n\r\n  `That's the reason they're called
    lessons,' the Gryphon\r\nremarked:  `because they lessen from day to day.'\r\n\r\n 
    This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a\r\nlittle before
    she made her next remark.  `Then the eleventh day\r\nmust have been a holiday?'\r\n\r\n 
    `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n  `And how did you manage on
    the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.\r\n\r\n  `That's enough about lessons,'
    the Gryphon interrupted in a\r\nvery decided tone:  `tell her something about
    the games now.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                     
    The Lobster Quadrille\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the
    back of one flapper\r\nacross his eyes.  He looked at Alice, and tried to speak,
    but for\r\na minute or two sobs choked his voice.  `Same as if he had a bone\r\nin
    his throat,' said the Gryphon:  and it set to work shaking him\r\nand punching
    him in the back.  At last the Mock Turtle recovered\r\nhis voice, and, with tears
    running down his cheeks, he went on\r\nagain:--\r\n\r\n  `You may not have lived
    much under the sea--' (`I haven't,'\r\nsaid Alice)--`and perhaps you were never
    even introduced to a lobster--'\r\n(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but
    checked herself hastily,\r\nand said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea
    what a delightful\r\nthing a Lobster Quadrille is!'\r\n\r\n  `No, indeed,' said
    Alice.  `What sort of a dance is it?'\r\n\r\n  `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you
    first form into a line along the\r\nsea-shore--'\r\n\r\n  `Two lines!' cried
    the Mock Turtle.  `Seals, turtles, salmon,\r\nand so on; then, when you've cleared
    all the jelly-fish out of\r\nthe way--'\r\n\r\n  `THAT generally takes some time,'
    interrupted the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n  `--you advance twice--'\r\n\r\n  `Each with
    a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n  `Of course,' the Mock Turtle
    said:  `advance twice, set to\r\npartners--'\r\n\r\n  `--change lobsters, and
    retire in same order,' continued the\r\nGryphon.\r\n\r\n  `Then, you know,' the
    Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'\r\n\r\n  `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon,
    with a bound into the air.\r\n\r\n  `--as far out to sea as you can--'\r\n\r\n 
    `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n  `Turn a somersault in the sea!'
    cried the Mock Turtle,\r\ncapering wildly about.\r\n\r\n  `Back to land again,
    and that's all the first figure,' said the\r\nMock Turtle, suddenly dropping
    his voice; and the two creatures,\r\nwho had been jumping about like mad things
    all this time, sat\r\ndown again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\r\n\r\n 
    `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.\r\n\r\n  `Would you like
    to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n  `Very much indeed,' said
    Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the\r\nGryphon. 
    `We can do without lobsters, you know.  Which shall\r\nsing?'\r\n\r\n  `Oh, YOU
    sing,' said the Gryphon.  `I've forgotten the words.'\r\n\r\n  So they began
    solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now\r\nand then treading on her
    toes when they passed too close, and\r\nwaving their forepaws to mark the time,
    while the Mock Turtle\r\nsang this, very slowly and sadly:--\r\n\r\n\r\n`\"Will
    you walk a little faster?\" said a whiting to a snail.\r\n\"There's a porpoise
    close behind us, and he's treading on my\r\n tail.\r\nSee how eagerly the lobsters
    and the turtles all advance!\r\nThey are waiting on the shingle--will you come
    and join the\r\ndance?\r\n\r\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, will
    you join the\r\ndance?\r\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you
    join the\r\ndance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You can really have no notion how delightful
    it will be\r\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to\r\n                                                     
    sea!\"\r\nBut the snail replied \"Too far, too far!\" and gave a look\r\n                                                      
    askance--\r\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the\r\n  
    dance.\r\n    Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join\r\n       
    the dance.\r\n    Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join\r\n       
    the dance.\r\n\r\n`\"What matters it how far we go?\" his scaly friend replied.\r\n\"There
    is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\r\nThe further off from England
    the nearer is to France--\r\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and
    join the dance.\r\n\r\n    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you
    join the\r\n         dance?\r\n    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you,
    won't you join the\r\n         dance?\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  `Thank you, it's a
    very interesting dance to watch,' said\r\nAlice, feeling very glad that it was
    over at last:  `and I do so\r\nlike that curious song about the whiting!'\r\n\r\n 
    `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've\r\nseen them, of
    course?'\r\n\r\n  `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she\r\nchecked
    herself hastily.\r\n\r\n  `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle,
    `but\r\nif you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're\r\nlike.'\r\n\r\n 
    `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully.  `They have their\r\ntails in their
    mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'\r\n\r\n  `You're wrong about the crumbs,'
    said the Mock Turtle:\r\n`crumbs would all wash off in the sea.  But they HAVE
    their tails\r\nin their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle\r\nyawned
    and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all\r\nthat,' he said to the
    Gryphon.\r\n\r\n  `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with\r\nthe
    lobsters to the dance.  So they got thrown out to sea.  So\r\nthey had to fall
    a long way.  So they got their tails fast in\r\ntheir mouths.  So they couldn't
    get them out again.  That's all.'\r\n\r\n  `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very
    interesting.  I never knew\r\nso much about a whiting before.'\r\n\r\n  `I can
    tell you more than that, if you like,' said the\r\nGryphon.  `Do you know why
    it's called a whiting?'\r\n\r\n  `I never thought about it,' said Alice.  `Why?'\r\n\r\n 
    `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very\r\nsolemnly.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice was thoroughly puzzled.  `Does the boots and shoes!' she\r\nrepeated in
    a wondering tone.\r\n\r\n  `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. 
    `I\r\nmean, what makes them so shiny?'\r\n\r\n  Alice looked down at them, and
    considered a little before she\r\ngave her answer.  `They're done with blacking,
    I believe.'\r\n\r\n  `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in
    a deep\r\nvoice, `are done with a whiting.  Now you know.'\r\n\r\n  `And what
    are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n  `Soles
    and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather\r\nimpatiently:  `any shrimp
    could have told you that.'\r\n\r\n  `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose
    thoughts were\r\nstill running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, \"Keep\r\nback,
    please:  we don't want YOU with us!\"'\r\n\r\n  `They were obliged to have him
    with them,' the Mock Turtle\r\nsaid:  `no wise fish would go anywhere without
    a porpoise.'\r\n\r\n  `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\r\n\r\n 
    `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle:  `why, if a fish came\r\nto ME, and told
    me he was going a journey, I should say \"With\r\nwhat porpoise?\"'\r\n\r\n 
    `Don't you mean \"purpose\"?' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `I mean what I say,' the Mock
    Turtle replied in an offended\r\ntone.  And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear
    some of YOUR\r\nadventures.'\r\n\r\n  `I could tell you my adventures--beginning
    from this morning,'\r\nsaid Alice a little timidly:  `but it's no use going back
    to\r\nyesterday, because I was a different person then.'\r\n\r\n  `Explain all
    that,' said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n  `No, no!  The adventures first,' said the
    Gryphon in an\r\nimpatient tone:  `explanations take such a dreadful time.'\r\n\r\n 
    So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when\r\nshe first saw
    the White Rabbit.  She was a little nervous about\r\nit just at first, the two
    creatures got so close to her, one on\r\neach side, and opened their eyes and
    mouths so VERY wide, but she\r\ngained courage as she went on.  Her listeners
    were perfectly\r\nquiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE
    OLD,\r\nFATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming\r\ndifferent,
    and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said\r\n`That's very curious.'\r\n\r\n 
    `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n  `It all
    came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated\r\nthoughtfully.  `I should like to
    hear her try and repeat\r\nsomething now.  Tell her to begin.'  He looked at
    the Gryphon as\r\nif he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.\r\n\r\n 
    `Stand up and repeat \"'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,\"' said\r\nthe Gryphon.\r\n\r\n 
    `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat\r\nlessons!' thought
    Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'\r\nHowever, she got up, and began
    to repeat it, but her head was so\r\nfull of the Lobster Quadrille, that she
    hardly knew what she was\r\nsaying, and the words came very queer indeed:--\r\n\r\n   
    `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\r\n    \"You have baked
    me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\"\r\n    As a duck with its eyelids, so he
    with his nose\r\n    Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'\r\n\r\n             
    [later editions continued as follows\r\n    When the sands are all dry, he is
    gay as a lark,\r\n    And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\r\n   
    But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\r\n    His voice has a timid
    and tremulous sound.]\r\n\r\n  `That's different from what I used to say when
    I was a child,'\r\nsaid the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n  `Well, I never heard it before,'
    said the Mock Turtle; `but it\r\nsounds uncommon nonsense.'\r\n\r\n  Alice said
    nothing; she had sat down with her face in her\r\nhands, wondering if anything
    would EVER happen in a natural way\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n  `I should like to have
    it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n  `She can't explain it,' said the
    Gryphon hastily.  `Go on with\r\nthe next verse.'\r\n\r\n  `But about his toes?'
    the Mock Turtle persisted.  `How COULD\r\nhe turn them out with his nose, you
    know?'\r\n\r\n  `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was\r\ndreadfully
    puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n  `Go
    on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently:\r\n`it begins \"I
    passed by his garden.\"'\r\n\r\n  Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt
    sure it would\r\nall come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--\r\n\r\n   
    `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\r\n    How the Owl and the
    Panther were sharing a pie--'\r\n\r\n        [later editions continued as follows\r\n   
    The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\r\n    While the Owl had the
    dish as its share of the treat.\r\n    When the pie was all finished, the Owl,
    as a boon,\r\n    Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\r\n    While the
    Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\r\n    And concluded the banquet--]\r\n\r\n 
    `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle\r\ninterrupted,
    `if you don't explain it as you go on?  It's by far\r\nthe most confusing thing
    I ever heard!'\r\n\r\n  `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: 
    and\r\nAlice was only too glad to do so.\r\n\r\n  `Shall we try another figure
    of the Lobster Quadrille?' the\r\nGryphon went on.  `Or would you like the Mock
    Turtle to sing you\r\na song?'\r\n\r\n  `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle
    would be so kind,'\r\nAlice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather\r\noffended
    tone, `Hm! No accounting for tastes!  Sing her \"Turtle\r\nSoup,\" will you,
    old fellow?'\r\n\r\n  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes\r\nchoked
    with sobs, to sing this:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\r\n   
    Waiting in a hot tureen!\r\n    Who for such dainties would not stoop?\r\n   
    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\r\n    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\r\n       
    Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\r\n        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\r\n    Soo--oop of
    the e--e--evening,\r\n        Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\r\n\r\n    `Beautiful
    Soup!  Who cares for fish,\r\n    Game, or any other dish?\r\n    Who would not
    give all else for two p\r\n    ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\r\n    Pennyworth
    only of beautiful Soup?\r\n        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\r\n        Beau--ootiful
    Soo--oop!\r\n    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\r\n        Beautiful, beauti--FUL
    SOUP!'\r\n\r\n  `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had\r\njust
    begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!'\r\nwas heard in the
    distance.\r\n\r\n  `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand,\r\nit
    hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.\r\n\r\n  `What trial is
    it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon\r\nonly answered `Come on!' and
    ran the faster, while more and more\r\nfaintly came, carried on the breeze that
    followed them, the\r\nmelancholy words:--\r\n\r\n    `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\r\n       
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER
    XI\r\n\r\n                      Who Stole the Tarts?\r\n\r\n\r\n  The King and
    Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when\r\nthey arrived, with a great
    crowd assembled about them--all sorts\r\nof little birds and beasts, as well
    as the whole pack of cards:\r\nthe Knave was standing before them, in chains,
    with a soldier on\r\neach side to guard him; and near the King was the White
    Rabbit,\r\nwith a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the\r\nother. 
    In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large\r\ndish of tarts upon
    it:  they looked so good, that it made Alice\r\nquite hungry to look at them--`I
    wish they'd get the trial done,'\r\nshe thought, `and hand round the refreshments!' 
    But there seemed\r\nto be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything
    about\r\nher, to pass away the time.\r\n\r\n  Alice had never been in a court
    of justice before, but she had\r\nread about them in books, and she was quite
    pleased to find that\r\nshe knew the name of nearly everything there.  `That's
    the\r\njudge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'\r\n\r\n  The
    judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown\r\nover the wig, (look
    at the frontispiece if you want to see how he\r\ndid it,) he did not look at
    all comfortable, and it was certainly\r\nnot becoming.\r\n\r\n  `And that's the
    jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve\r\ncreatures,' (she was obliged to
    say `creatures,' you see, because\r\nsome of them were animals, and some were
    birds,) `I suppose they\r\nare the jurors.'  She said this last word two or three
    times over\r\nto herself, being rather proud of it:  for she thought, and\r\nrightly
    too, that very few little girls of her age knew the\r\nmeaning of it at all. 
    However, `jury-men' would have done just\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n  The twelve jurors
    were all writing very busily on slates.\r\n`What are they doing?'  Alice whispered
    to the Gryphon.  `They\r\ncan't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's
    begun.'\r\n\r\n  `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in\r\nreply,
    `for fear they should forget them before the end of the\r\ntrial.'\r\n\r\n  `Stupid
    things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but\r\nshe stopped hastily,
    for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in\r\nthe court!' and the King put on
    his spectacles and looked\r\nanxiously round, to make out who was talking.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their\r\nshoulders, that
    all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'\r\non their slates, and she
    could even make out that one of them\r\ndidn't know how to spell `stupid,' and
    that he had to ask his\r\nneighbour to tell him.  `A nice muddle their slates'll
    be in\r\nbefore the trial's over!' thought Alice.\r\n\r\n  One of the jurors
    had a pencil that squeaked.  This of course,\r\nAlice could not stand, and she
    went round the court and got\r\nbehind him, and very soon found an opportunity
    of taking it\r\naway.  She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was\r\nBill,
    the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of\r\nit; so, after hunting
    all about for it, he was obliged to write\r\nwith one finger for the rest of
    the day; and this was of very\r\nlittle use, as it left no mark on the slate.\r\n\r\n 
    `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.\r\n\r\n  On this the White Rabbit
    blew three blasts on the trumpet, and\r\nthen unrolled the parchment scroll,
    and read as follows:--\r\n\r\n    `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\r\n         
    All on a summer day:\r\n      The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\r\n         
    And took them quite away!'\r\n\r\n  `Consider your verdict,' the King said to
    the jury.\r\n\r\n  `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted.  `There's\r\na
    great deal to come before that!'\r\n\r\n  `Call the first witness,' said the
    King; and the White Rabbit\r\nblew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out,
    `First\r\nwitness!'\r\n\r\n  The first witness was the Hatter.  He came in with
    a teacup in\r\none hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.  `I beg\r\npardon,
    your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in:  but I\r\nhadn't quite finished
    my tea when I was sent for.'\r\n\r\n  `You ought to have finished,' said the
    King.  `When did you\r\nbegin?'\r\n\r\n  The Hatter looked at the March Hare,
    who had followed him into\r\nthe court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.  `Fourteenth
    of March, I\r\nthink it was,' he said.\r\n\r\n  `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n 
    `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.\r\n\r\n  `Write that down,' the King said to
    the jury, and the jury\r\neagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates,
    and then\r\nadded them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.\r\n\r\n 
    `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.\r\n\r\n  `It isn't mine,' said
    the Hatter.\r\n\r\n  `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who\r\ninstantly
    made a memorandum of the fact.\r\n\r\n  `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added
    as an explanation;\r\n`I've none of my own.  I'm a hatter.'\r\n\r\n  Here the
    Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the\r\nHatter, who turned pale
    and fidgeted.\r\n\r\n  `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous,
    or\r\nI'll have you executed on the spot.'\r\n\r\n  This did not seem to encourage
    the witness at all:  he kept\r\nshifting from one foot to the other, looking
    uneasily at the\r\nQueen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his\r\nteacup
    instead of the bread-and-butter.\r\n\r\n  Just at this moment Alice felt a very
    curious sensation, which\r\npuzzled her a good deal until she made out what it
    was:  she was\r\nbeginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she\r\nwould
    get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she\r\ndecided to remain where
    she was as long as there was room for\r\nher.\r\n\r\n  `I wish you wouldn't squeeze
    so.' said the Dormouse, who was\r\nsitting next to her.  `I can hardly breathe.'\r\n\r\n 
    `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly:  `I'm growing.'\r\n\r\n  `You've no
    right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.\r\n\r\n  `Don't talk nonsense,' said
    Alice more boldly:  `you know\r\nyou're growing too.'\r\n\r\n  `Yes, but I grow
    at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:\r\n`not in that ridiculous fashion.' 
    And he got up very sulkily\r\nand crossed over to the other side of the court.\r\n\r\n 
    All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the\r\nHatter, and, just
    as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to\r\none of the officers of the
    court, `Bring me the list of the\r\nsingers in the last concert!' on which the
    wretched Hatter\r\ntrembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.\r\n\r\n  `Give
    your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have\r\nyou executed, whether
    you're nervous or not.'\r\n\r\n  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began,
    in a\r\ntrembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week\r\nor
    so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and\r\nthe twinkling
    of the tea--'\r\n\r\n  `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.\r\n\r\n  `It
    began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.\r\n\r\n  `Of course twinkling begins
    with a T!' said the King sharply.\r\n`Do you take me for a dunce?  Go on!'\r\n\r\n 
    `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things\r\ntwinkled after that--only
    the March Hare said--'\r\n\r\n  `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great
    hurry.\r\n\r\n  `You did!' said the Hatter.\r\n\r\n  `I deny it!' said the March
    Hare.\r\n\r\n  `He denies it,' said the King:  `leave out that part.'\r\n\r\n 
    `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,\r\nlooking anxiously
    round to see if he would deny it too:  but the\r\nDormouse denied nothing, being
    fast asleep.\r\n\r\n  `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-\r\nand-butter--'\r\n\r\n 
    `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.\r\n\r\n  `That I can't
    remember,' said the Hatter.\r\n\r\n  `You MUST remember,' remarked the King,
    `or I'll have you\r\nexecuted.'\r\n\r\n  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup
    and bread-and-butter,\r\nand went down on one knee.  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,'
    he\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n  `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.\r\n\r\n  Here
    one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately\r\nsuppressed by the officers
    of the court.  (As that is rather a\r\nhard word, I will just explain to you
    how it was done.  They had\r\na large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth
    with strings:\r\ninto this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then
    sat\r\nupon it.)\r\n\r\n  `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.  `I've
    so often\r\nread in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some\r\nattempts
    at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the\r\nofficers of the court,\"
    and I never understood what it meant\r\ntill now.'\r\n\r\n  `If that's all you
    know about it, you may stand down,'\r\ncontinued the King.\r\n\r\n  `I can't
    go no lower,' said the Hatter:  `I'm on the floor, as\r\nit is.'\r\n\r\n  `Then
    you may SIT down,' the King replied.\r\n\r\n  Here the other guinea-pig cheered,
    and was suppressed.\r\n\r\n  `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 
    `Now we\r\nshall get on better.'\r\n\r\n  `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the
    Hatter, with an anxious\r\nlook at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\r\n\r\n 
    `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the\r\ncourt, without
    even waiting to put his shoes on.\r\n\r\n  `--and just take his head off outside,'
    the Queen added to one\r\nof the officers:  but the Hatter was out of sight before
    the\r\nofficer could get to the door.\r\n\r\n  `Call the next witness!' said
    the King.\r\n\r\n  The next witness was the Duchess's cook.  She carried the\r\npepper-box
    in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before\r\nshe got into the court,
    by the way the people near the door began\r\nsneezing all at once.\r\n\r\n  `Give
    your evidence,' said the King.\r\n\r\n  `Shan't,' said the cook.\r\n\r\n  The
    King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a\r\nlow voice, `Your
    Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'\r\n\r\n  `Well, if I must, I must,'
    the King said, with a melancholy\r\nair, and, after folding his arms and frowning
    at the cook till\r\nhis eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice,
    `What\r\nare tarts made of?'\r\n\r\n  `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.\r\n\r\n 
    `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.\r\n\r\n  `Collar that Dormouse,' the
    Queen shrieked out.  `Behead that\r\nDormouse!  Turn that Dormouse out of court! 
    Suppress him!  Pinch\r\nhim!  Off with his whiskers!'\r\n\r\n  For some minutes
    the whole court was in confusion, getting the\r\nDormouse turned out, and, by
    the time they had settled down\r\nagain, the cook had disappeared.\r\n\r\n  `Never
    mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.\r\n`Call the next witness.' 
    And he added in an undertone to the\r\nQueen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine
    the next witness.\r\nIt quite makes my forehead ache!'\r\n\r\n  Alice watched
    the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,\r\nfeeling very curious to see
    what the next witness would be like,\r\n`--for they haven't got much evidence
    YET,' she said to herself.\r\nImagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read
    out, at the top\r\nof his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          
    CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                        Alice's Evidence\r\n\r\n\r\n  `Here!'
    cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the\r\nmoment how large she had
    grown in the last few minutes, and she\r\njumped up in such a hurry that she
    tipped over the jury-box with\r\nthe edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen
    on to the heads\r\nof the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding\r\nher
    very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset\r\nthe week before.\r\n\r\n 
    `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great\r\ndismay, and began
    picking them up again as quickly as she could,\r\nfor the accident of the goldfish
    kept running in her head, and\r\nshe had a vague sort of idea that they must
    be collected at once\r\nand put back into the jury-box, or they would die.\r\n\r\n 
    `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave\r\nvoice, `until all
    the jurymen are back in their proper places--\r\nALL,' he repeated with great
    emphasis, looking hard at Alice as\r\nhe said do.\r\n\r\n  Alice looked at the
    jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she\r\nhad put the Lizard in head downwards,
    and the poor little thing\r\nwas waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being
    quite unable\r\nto move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that\r\nit
    signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it\r\nwould be QUITE as
    much use in the trial one way up as the other.'\r\n\r\n  As soon as the jury
    had a little recovered from the shock of\r\nbeing upset, and their slates and
    pencils had been found and\r\nhanded back to them, they set to work very diligently
    to write\r\nout a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed\r\ntoo
    much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,\r\ngazing up into the
    roof of the court.\r\n\r\n  `What do you know about this business?' the King
    said to\r\nAlice.\r\n\r\n  `Nothing,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Nothing WHATEVER?'
    persisted the King.\r\n\r\n  `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `That's
    very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.\r\nThey were just beginning
    to write this down on their slates, when\r\nthe White Rabbit interrupted:  `UNimportant,
    your Majesty means,\r\nof course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning
    and\r\nmaking faces at him as he spoke.\r\n\r\n  `UNimportant, of course, I meant,'
    the King hastily said, and\r\nwent on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--\r\nunimportant--important--'
    as if he were trying which word\r\nsounded best.\r\n\r\n  Some of the jury wrote
    it down `important,' and some\r\n`unimportant.'  Alice could see this, as she
    was near enough to\r\nlook over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,'
    she\r\nthought to herself.\r\n\r\n  At this moment the King, who had been for
    some time busily\r\nwriting in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read
    out\r\nfrom his book, `Rule Forty-two.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE\r\nHIGH
    TO LEAVE THE COURT.'\r\n\r\n  Everybody looked at Alice.\r\n\r\n  `I'M not a
    mile high,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `You are,' said the King.\r\n\r\n  `Nearly two
    miles high,' added the Queen.\r\n\r\n  `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said
    Alice:  `besides,\r\nthat's not a regular rule:  you invented it just now.'\r\n\r\n 
    `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.\r\n\r\n  `Then it ought to
    be Number One,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  The King turned pale, and shut his note-book
    hastily.\r\n`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n 
    `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said\r\nthe White Rabbit,
    jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has\r\njust been picked up.'\r\n\r\n 
    `What's in it?' said the Queen.\r\n\r\n  `I haven't opened it yet,' said the
    White Rabbit, `but it seems\r\nto be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to
    somebody.'\r\n\r\n  `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was\r\nwritten
    to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'\r\n\r\n  `Who is it directed to?' said
    one of the jurymen.\r\n\r\n  `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit;
    `in fact,\r\nthere's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper\r\nas
    he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set\r\nof verses.'\r\n\r\n 
    `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of\r\nthey jurymen.\r\n\r\n 
    `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the\r\nqueerest thing about
    it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)\r\n\r\n  `He must have imitated somebody
    else's hand,' said the King.\r\n(The jury all brightened up again.)\r\n\r\n 
    `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and\r\nthey can't
    prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'\r\n\r\n  `If you didn't sign
    it,' said the King, `that only makes the\r\nmatter worse.  You MUST have meant
    some mischief, or else you'd\r\nhave signed your name like an honest man.'\r\n\r\n 
    There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the\r\nfirst really clever
    thing the King had said that day.\r\n\r\n  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the
    Queen.\r\n\r\n  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't\r\neven
    know what they're about!'\r\n\r\n  `Read them,' said the King.\r\n\r\n  The White
    Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,\r\nplease your Majesty?'
    he asked.\r\n\r\n  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on\r\ntill
    you come to the end:  then stop.'\r\n\r\n  These were the verses the White Rabbit
    read:--\r\n\r\n        `They told me you had been to her,\r\n          And mentioned
    me to him:\r\n        She gave me a good character,\r\n          But said I could
    not swim.\r\n\r\n        He sent them word I had not gone\r\n          (We know
    it to be true):\r\n        If she should push the matter on,\r\n          What
    would become of you?\r\n\r\n        I gave her one, they gave him two,\r\n         
    You gave us three or more;\r\n        They all returned from him to you,\r\n         
    Though they were mine before.\r\n\r\n        If I or she should chance to be\r\n         
    Involved in this affair,\r\n        He trusts to you to set them free,\r\n         
    Exactly as we were.\r\n\r\n        My notion was that you had been\r\n         
    (Before she had this fit)\r\n        An obstacle that came between\r\n         
    Him, and ourselves, and it.\r\n\r\n        Don't let him know she liked them
    best,\r\n          For this must ever be\r\n        A secret, kept from all the
    rest,\r\n          Between yourself and me.'\r\n\r\n  `That's the most important
    piece of evidence we've heard yet,'\r\nsaid the King, rubbing his hands; `so
    now let the jury--'\r\n\r\n  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice,
    (she had\r\ngrown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit\r\nafraid
    of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't\r\nbelieve there's
    an atom of meaning in it.'\r\n\r\n  The jury all wrote down on their slates,
    `SHE doesn't believe\r\nthere's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted
    to\r\nexplain the paper.\r\n\r\n  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King,
    `that saves a\r\nworld of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. 
    And\r\nyet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his\r\nknee,
    and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some\r\nmeaning in them, after
    all.  \"--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--\" you\r\ncan't swim, can you?' he added, turning
    to the Knave.\r\n\r\n  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?'
    he said.\r\n(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)\r\n\r\n 
    `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering\r\nover the verses
    to himself:  `\"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--\" that's\r\nthe jury, of course-- \"I
    GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--\" why,\r\nthat must be what he did with the
    tarts, you know--'\r\n\r\n  `But, it goes on \"THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO
    YOU,\"' said\r\nAlice.\r\n\r\n  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly,
    pointing to\r\nthe tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.\r\nThen
    again--\"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--\"  you never had fits, my\r\ndear, I think?'
    he said to the Queen.\r\n\r\n  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an
    inkstand at the\r\nLizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left
    off\r\nwriting on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no\r\nmark;
    but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was\r\ntrickling down his
    face, as long as it lasted.)\r\n\r\n  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the
    King, looking round\r\nthe court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.\r\n\r\n 
    `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and\r\neverybody laughed, `Let
    the jury consider their verdict,' the\r\nKing said, for about the twentieth time
    that day.\r\n\r\n  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'\r\n\r\n 
    `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having\r\nthe sentence
    first!'\r\n\r\n  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.\r\n\r\n 
    `I won't!' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the
    top of her voice.\r\nNobody moved.\r\n\r\n  `Who cares for you?' said Alice,
    (she had grown to her full\r\nsize by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack
    of cards!'\r\n\r\n  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying\r\ndown
    upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half\r\nof anger, and
    tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on\r\nthe bank, with her head
    in the lap of her sister, who was gently\r\nbrushing away some dead leaves that
    had fluttered down from the\r\ntrees upon her face.\r\n\r\n  `Wake up, Alice
    dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long\r\nsleep you've had!'\r\n\r\n  `Oh,
    I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told\r\nher sister, as well
    as she could remember them, all these strange\r\nAdventures of hers that you
    have just been reading about; and\r\nwhen she had finished, her sister kissed
    her, and said, `It WAS a\r\ncurious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to
    your tea; it's\r\ngetting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while
    she\r\nran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.\r\n\r\n  But
    her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her\r\nhead on her hand, watching
    the setting sun, and thinking of\r\nlittle Alice and all her wonderful Adventures,
    till she too began\r\ndreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--\r\n\r\n 
    First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the\r\ntiny hands
    were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes\r\nwere looking up into
    hers--she could hear the very tones of her\r\nvoice, and see that queer little
    toss of her head to keep back\r\nthe wandering hair that WOULD always get into
    her eyes--and\r\nstill as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place\r\naround
    her became alive the strange creatures of her little\r\nsister's dream.\r\n\r\n 
    The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried\r\nby--the frightened
    Mouse splashed his way through the\r\nneighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle
    of the teacups as\r\nthe March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending
    meal,\r\nand the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate\r\nguests
    to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the\r\nDuchess's knee, while
    plates and dishes crashed around it--once\r\nmore the shriek of the Gryphon,
    the squeaking of the Lizard's\r\nslate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed
    guinea-pigs,\r\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable\r\nMock
    Turtle.\r\n\r\n  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\r\nWonderland,
    though she knew she had but to open them again, and\r\nall would change to dull
    reality--the grass would be only\r\nrustling in the wind, and the pool rippling
    to the waving of the\r\nreeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling
    sheep-\r\nbells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd\r\nboy--and
    the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and\r\nall thy other queer
    noises, would change (she knew) to the\r\nconfused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while
    the lowing of the\r\ncattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock
    Turtle's\r\nheavy sobs.\r\n\r\n  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same
    little sister of\r\nhers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman;
    and how\r\nshe would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and\r\nloving
    heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about\r\nher other little children,
    and make THEIR eyes bright and eager\r\nwith many a strange tale, perhaps even
    with the dream of\r\nWonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all
    their\r\nsimple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,\r\nremembering
    her own child-life, and the happy summer days.\r\n\r\n                            
    THE END\r\n\u200B"

    Lewis Carroll\r\n\r\n               THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 2.9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           
    CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                      Down the Rabbit-Hole\r\n\r\n\r\n  Alice
    was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister\r\non the bank, and
    of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had\r\npeeped into the book her sister
    was reading, but it had no\r\npictures or conversations in it, `and what is the
    use of a book,'\r\nthought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'\r\n\r\n 
    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,\r\nfor the hot
    day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether\r\nthe pleasure of making
    a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble\r\nof getting up and picking the daisies,
    when suddenly a White\r\nRabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\r\n\r\n  There
    was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice\r\nthink it so VERY much
    out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to\r\nitself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall
    be late!'  (when she thought\r\nit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she
    ought to have\r\nwondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\r\nbut
    when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\r\nPOCKET, and looked
    at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to\r\nher feet, for it flashed across
    her mind that she had never\r\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket,
    or a watch to\r\ntake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\r\nfield
    after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\r\ndown a large rabbit-hole
    under the hedge.\r\n\r\n  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once\r\nconsidering
    how in the world she was to get out again.\r\n\r\n  The rabbit-hole went straight
    on like a tunnel for some way,\r\nand then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly
    that Alice had not a\r\nmoment to think about stopping herself before she found
    herself\r\nfalling down a very deep well.\r\n\r\n  Either the well was very deep,
    or she fell very slowly, for she\r\nhad plenty of time as she went down to look
    about her and to\r\nwonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to
    look\r\ndown and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to\r\nsee
    anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\r\nnoticed that they
    were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;\r\nhere and there she saw maps and
    pictures hung upon pegs.  She\r\ntook down a jar from one of the shelves as she
    passed; it was\r\nlabelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment
    it\r\nwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing\r\nsomebody,
    so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she\r\nfell past it.\r\n\r\n 
    `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I\r\nshall think
    nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll\r\nall think me at home! 
    Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,\r\neven if I fell off the top of the house!'
    (Which was very likely\r\ntrue.)\r\n\r\n  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER
    come to an end!  `I\r\nwonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said
    aloud.\r\n`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let\r\nme
    see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,\r\nyou see, Alice
    had learnt several things of this sort in her\r\nlessons in the schoolroom, and
    though this was not a VERY good\r\nopportunity for showing off her knowledge,
    as there was no one to\r\nlisten to her, still it was good practice to say it
    over) `--yes,\r\nthat's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\r\nor
    Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,\r\nor Longitude
    either, but thought they were nice grand words to\r\nsay.)\r\n\r\n  Presently
    she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right\r\nTHROUGH the earth!  How
    funny it'll seem to come out among the\r\npeople that walk with their heads downward! 
    The Antipathies, I\r\nthink--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening,
    this\r\ntime, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall\r\nhave
    to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\r\nPlease, Ma'am, is this
    New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried\r\nto curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING
    as you're falling\r\nthrough the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And
    what\r\nan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll\r\nnever
    do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\r\n\r\n  Down, down,
    down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon\r\nbegan talking again.  `Dinah'll
    miss me very much to-night, I\r\nshould think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope
    they'll remember\r\nher saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you
    were\r\ndown here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but\r\nyou
    might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.\r\nBut do cats eat
    bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get\r\nrather sleepy, and went on saying
    to herself, in a dreamy sort of\r\nway, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?'
    and sometimes, `Do\r\nbats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\r\nquestion,
    it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt\r\nthat she was dozing
    off, and had just begun to dream that she\r\nwas walking hand in hand with Dinah,
    and saying to her very\r\nearnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you
    ever eat a\r\nbat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\r\nsticks
    and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\r\n\r\n  Alice was not a bit hurt, and
    she jumped up on to her feet in a\r\nmoment:  she looked up, but it was all dark
    overhead; before her\r\nwas another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still
    in\r\nsight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:\r\naway went
    Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it\r\nsay, as it turned a corner,
    `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\r\nit's getting!'  She was close behind it
    when she turned the\r\ncorner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she
    found\r\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\r\nhanging
    from the roof.\r\n\r\n  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all
    locked;\r\nand when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\r\nother,
    trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\r\nwondering how she was
    ever to get out again.\r\n\r\n  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged
    table, all made of\r\nsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden
    key,\r\nand Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\r\ndoors
    of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\r\nthe key was too
    small, but at any rate it would not open any of\r\nthem.  However, on the second
    time round, she came upon a low\r\ncurtain she had not noticed before, and behind
    it was a little\r\ndoor about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden
    key\r\nin the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\r\n\r\n  Alice opened
    the door and found that it led into a small\r\npassage, not much larger than
    a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\r\nlooked along the passage into the loveliest
    garden you ever saw.\r\nHow she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander
    about\r\namong those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\r\nshe
    could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if\r\nmy head would
    go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\r\nvery little use without my
    shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\r\nI could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could,
    if I only\r\nknow how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\r\nhad
    happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\r\nthings indeed
    were really impossible.\r\n\r\n  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the
    little door, so she\r\nwent back to the table, half hoping she might find another
    key on\r\nit, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\r\ntelescopes: 
    this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\r\ncertainly was not here
    before,' said Alice,) and round the neck\r\nof the bottle was a paper label,
    with the words `DRINK ME'\r\nbeautifully printed on it in large letters.\r\n\r\n 
    It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\r\nAlice was not
    going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look\r\nfirst,' she said, `and see whether
    it's marked \"poison\" or not';\r\nfor she had read several nice little histories
    about children who\r\nhad got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\r\nthings,
    all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\r\ntheir friends had taught
    them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\r\nwill burn you if you hold it too long;
    and that if you cut your\r\nfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds;
    and she had\r\nnever forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\r\n`poison,'
    it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n  However,
    this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\r\nto taste it, and finding
    it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\r\nof mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard,
    pine-apple, roast\r\nturkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\r\nit
    off.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        
    *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     *       *       *      
    *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must
    be shutting up\r\nlike a telescope.'\r\n\r\n  And so it was indeed:  she was
    now only ten inches high, and\r\nher face brightened up at the thought that she
    was now the right\r\nsize for going though the little door into that lovely garden.\r\nFirst,
    however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was\r\ngoing to shrink any
    further:  she felt a little nervous about\r\nthis; `for it might end, you know,'
    said Alice to herself, `in my\r\ngoing out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder
    what I should be\r\nlike then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle
    is\r\nlike after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\r\never
    having seen such a thing.\r\n\r\n  After a while, finding that nothing more happened,
    she decided\r\non going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when\r\nshe
    got to the door, she found he had forgotten the little golden\r\nkey, and when
    she went back to the table for it, she found she\r\ncould not possibly reach
    it:  she could see it quite plainly\r\nthrough the glass, and she tried her best
    to climb up one of the\r\nlegs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when
    she had\r\ntired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and\r\ncried.\r\n\r\n 
    `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to\r\nherself, rather
    sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'\r\nShe generally gave herself
    very good advice, (though she very\r\nseldom followed it), and sometimes she
    scolded herself so\r\nseverely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she
    remembered\r\ntrying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game\r\nof
    croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious\r\nchild was very fond
    of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no\r\nuse now,' thought poor Alice,
    `to pretend to be two people!  Why,\r\nthere's hardly enough of me left to make
    ONE respectable\r\nperson!'\r\n\r\n  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box
    that was lying under\r\nthe table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small
    cake, on\r\nwhich the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.\r\n`Well,
    I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,\r\nI can reach the
    key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep\r\nunder the door; so either
    way I'll get into the garden, and I\r\ndon't care which happens!'\r\n\r\n  She
    ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which\r\nway?  Which way?',
    holding her hand on the top of her head to\r\nfeel which way it was growing,
    and she was quite surprised to\r\nfind that she remained the same size:  to be
    sure, this generally\r\nhappens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much
    into the\r\nway of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,\r\nthat
    it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the\r\ncommon way.\r\n\r\n 
    So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\r\n\r\n     *      
    *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n         *       *       *

    The Pool of Tears\r\n\r\n\r\n  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was
    so much\r\nsurprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good\r\nEnglish);
    `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that\r\never was!  Good-bye,
    feet!' (for when she looked down at her\r\nfeet, they seemed to be almost out
    of sight, they were getting so\r\nfar off).  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder
    who will put on\r\nyour shoes and stockings for you now, dears?  I'm sure _I_
    shan't\r\nbe able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself\r\nabout
    you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be\r\nkind to them,'
    thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the\r\nway I want to go!  Let me see: 
    I'll give them a new pair of\r\nboots every Christmas.'\r\n\r\n  And she went
    on planning to herself how she would manage it.\r\n`They must go by the carrier,'
    she thought; `and how funny it'll\r\nseem, sending presents to one's own feet! 
    And how odd the\r\ndirections will look!\r\n\r\n            ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT,
    ESQ.\r\n                HEARTHRUG,\r\n                    NEAR THE FENDER,\r\n                       
    (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).\r\n\r\nOh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'\r\n\r\n  Just
    then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in\r\nfact she was now more
    than nine feet high, and she at once took\r\nup the little golden key and hurried
    off to the garden door.\r\n\r\n  Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do,
    lying down on one\r\nside, to look through into the garden with one eye; but
    to get\r\nthrough was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to\r\ncry
    again.\r\n\r\n  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great\r\ngirl
    like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in\r\nthis way!  Stop
    this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all\r\nthe same, shedding gallons
    of tears, until there was a large pool\r\nall round her, about four inches deep
    and reaching half down the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\n  After a time she heard a little
    pattering of feet in the\r\ndistance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what
    was coming.\r\nIt was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a\r\npair
    of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the\r\nother:  he came trotting
    along in a great hurry, muttering to\r\nhimself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess,
    the Duchess! Oh! won't she\r\nbe savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt
    so desperate\r\nthat she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit\r\ncame
    near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,\r\nsir--'  The Rabbit
    started violently, dropped the white kid\r\ngloves and the fan, and skurried
    away into the darkness as hard\r\nas he could go.\r\n\r\n  Alice took up the
    fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very\r\nhot, she kept fanning herself all
    the time she went on talking:\r\n`Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day! 
    And yesterday\r\nthings went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed
    in\r\nthe night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this\r\nmorning? 
    I almost think I can remember feeling a little\r\ndifferent.  But if I'm not
    the same, the next question is, Who in\r\nthe world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great
    puzzle!'  And she began\r\nthinking over all the children she knew that were
    of the same age\r\nas herself, to see if she could have been changed for any
    of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n  `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in
    such\r\nlong ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm\r\nsure
    I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,\r\noh! she knows such
    a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,\r\nand--oh dear, how puzzling
    it all is!  I'll try if I know all the\r\nthings I used to know.  Let me see: 
    four times five is twelve,\r\nand four times six is thirteen, and four times
    seven is--oh dear!\r\nI shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, the\r\nMultiplication
    Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.\r\nLondon is the capital of Paris,
    and Paris is the capital of Rome,\r\nand Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! 
    I must have been\r\nchanged for Mabel!  I'll try and say \"How doth the little--\"'\r\nand
    she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,\r\nand began
    to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and\r\nstrange, and the words did
    not come the same as they used to do:--\r\n\r\n            `How doth the little
    crocodile\r\n              Improve his shining tail,\r\n            And pour
    the waters of the Nile\r\n              On every golden scale!\r\n\r\n           
    `How cheerfully he seems to grin,\r\n              How neatly spread his claws,\r\n           
    And welcome little fishes in\r\n              With gently smiling jaws!'\r\n\r\n 
    `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and\r\nher eyes filled
    with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel\r\nafter all, and I shall have
    to go and live in that poky little\r\nhouse, and have next to no toys to play
    with, and oh! ever so\r\nmany lessons to learn!  No, I've made up my mind about
    it; if I'm\r\nMabel, I'll stay down here!  It'll be no use their putting their\r\nheads
    down and saying \"Come up again, dear!\"  I shall only look\r\nup and say \"Who
    am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I\r\nlike being that person, I'll
    come up:  if not, I'll stay down\r\nhere till I'm somebody else\"--but, oh dear!'
    cried Alice, with a\r\nsudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their
    heads\r\ndown!  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'\r\n\r\n  As she
    said this she looked down at her hands, and was\r\nsurprised to see that she
    had put on one of the Rabbit's little\r\nwhite kid gloves while she was talking. 
    `How CAN I have done\r\nthat?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.' 
    She got up\r\nand went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,\r\nas
    nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,\r\nand was going
    on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the\r\ncause of this was the fan
    she was holding, and she dropped it\r\nhastily, just in time to avoid shrinking
    away altogether.\r\n\r\n`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened
    at\r\nthe sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in\r\nexistence;
    `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed\r\nback to the little door: 
    but, alas! the little door was shut\r\nagain, and the little golden key was lying
    on the glass table as\r\nbefore, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the
    poor child,\r\n`for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare\r\nit's
    too bad, that it is!'\r\n\r\n  As she said these words her foot slipped, and
    in another\r\nmoment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  He first\r\nidea
    was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that\r\ncase I can go back
    by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had\r\nbeen to the seaside once in
    her life, and had come to the general\r\nconclusion, that wherever you go to
    on the English coast you find\r\na number of bathing machines in the sea, some
    children digging in\r\nthe sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses,
    and\r\nbehind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that\r\nshe
    was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine\r\nfeet high.\r\n\r\n 
    `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,\r\ntrying to
    find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I\r\nsuppose, by being drowned
    in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer\r\nthing, to be sure!  However, everything
    is queer to-day.'\r\n\r\n  Just then she heard something splashing about in the
    pool a\r\nlittle way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at\r\nfirst
    she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then\r\nshe remembered how
    small she was now, and she soon made out that\r\nit was only a mouse that had
    slipped in like herself.\r\n\r\n  `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice,
    `to speak to this\r\nmouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that
    I should\r\nthink very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in\r\ntrying.' 
    So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of\r\nthis pool?  I am very
    tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'\r\n(Alice thought this must be the right
    way of speaking to a mouse:\r\nshe had never done such a thing before, but she
    remembered having\r\nseen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to
    a\r\nmouse--a mouse--O mouse!'  The Mouse looked at her rather\r\ninquisitively,
    and seemed to her to wink with one of its little\r\neyes, but it said nothing.\r\n\r\n 
    `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I\r\ndaresay it's a
    French mouse, come over with William the\r\nConqueror.'  (For, with all her knowledge
    of history, Alice had\r\nno very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) 
    So she\r\nbegan again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in\r\nher
    French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the\r\nwater, and seemed
    to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I beg\r\nyour pardon!' cried Alice hastily,
    afraid that she had hurt the\r\npoor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you
    didn't like cats.'\r\n\r\n  `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate\r\nvoice. 
    `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'\r\n\r\n  `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice
    in a soothing tone:  `don't be\r\nangry about it.  And yet I wish I could show
    you our cat Dinah:\r\nI think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see
    her.\r\nShe is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,\r\nas
    she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so\r\nnicely by the
    fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and\r\nshe is such a nice soft thing
    to nurse--and she's such a capital\r\none for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!'
    cried Alice again,\r\nfor this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she
    felt\r\ncertain it must be really offended.  `We won't talk about her any\r\nmore
    if you'd rather not.'\r\n\r\n  `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling
    down to the end\r\nof his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our
    family\r\nalways HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear\r\nthe
    name again!'\r\n\r\n  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change
    the\r\nsubject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'\r\nThe
    Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is\r\nsuch a nice little
    dog near our house I should like to show you!\r\nA little bright-eyed terrier,
    you know, with oh, such long curly\r\nbrown hair!  And it'll fetch things when
    you throw them, and\r\nit'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of
    things--I\r\ncan't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you\r\nknow,
    and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!\r\nHe says it kills
    all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a\r\nsorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've
    offended it again!'  For the\r\nMouse was swimming away from her as hard as it
    could go, and\r\nmaking quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\r\n\r\n  So
    she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back\r\nagain, and we won't
    talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't\r\nlike them!'  When the Mouse heard
    this, it turned round and swam\r\nslowly back to her:  its face was quite pale
    (with passion, Alice\r\nthought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let
    us get to\r\nthe shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll\r\nunderstand
    why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\r\n\r\n  It was high time to go, for the pool
    was getting quite crowded\r\nwith the birds and animals that had fallen into
    it:  there were a\r\nDuck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other
    curious\r\ncreatures.  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          
    CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                  A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\r\n\r\n\r\n 
    They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the\r\nbank--the birds
    with draggled feathers, the animals with their\r\nfur clinging close to them,
    and all dripping wet, cross, and\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\n  The first question
    of course was, how to get dry again:  they\r\nhad a consultation about this,
    and after a few minutes it seemed\r\nquite natural to Alice to find herself talking
    familiarly with\r\nthem, as if she had known them all her life.  Indeed, she
    had\r\nquite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,\r\nand
    would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';\r\nand this Alice
    would not allow without knowing how old it was,\r\nand, as the Lory positively
    refused to tell its age, there was no\r\nmore to be said.\r\n\r\n  At last the
    Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among\r\nthem, called out, `Sit
    down, all of you, and listen to me!  I'LL\r\nsoon make you dry enough!'  They
    all sat down at once, in a large\r\nring, with the Mouse in the middle.  Alice
    kept her eyes\r\nanxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad\r\ncold
    if she did not get dry very soon.\r\n\r\n  `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important
    air, `are you all ready?\r\nThis is the driest thing I know.  Silence all round,
    if you please!\r\n\"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope,
    was\r\nsoon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been\r\nof
    late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.  Edwin and\r\nMorcar, the earls
    of Mercia and Northumbria--\"'\r\n\r\n  `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.\r\n\r\n 
    `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very\r\npolitely:  `Did you
    speak?'\r\n\r\n  `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.\r\n\r\n  `I thought you did,'
    said the Mouse.  `--I proceed.  \"Edwin and\r\nMorcar, the earls of Mercia and
    Northumbria, declared for him:\r\nand even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop
    of Canterbury, found\r\nit advisable--\"'\r\n\r\n  `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.\r\n\r\n 
    `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly:  `of course you\r\nknow what \"it\"
    means.'\r\n\r\n  `I know what \"it\" means well enough, when I find a thing,'
    said\r\nthe Duck:  `it's generally a frog or a worm.  The question is,\r\nwhat
    did the archbishop find?'\r\n\r\n  The Mouse did not notice this question, but
    hurriedly went on,\r\n`\"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet
    William\r\nand offer him the crown.  William's conduct at first was\r\nmoderate. 
    But the insolence of his Normans--\"  How are you\r\ngetting on now, my dear?'
    it continued, turning to Alice as it\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n  `As wet as ever,' said
    Alice in a melancholy tone:  `it doesn't\r\nseem to dry me at all.'\r\n\r\n 
    `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I\r\nmove that the
    meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more\r\nenergetic remedies--'\r\n\r\n 
    `Speak English!' said the Eaglet.  `I don't know the meaning of\r\nhalf those
    long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do\r\neither!'  And the Eaglet
    bent down its head to hide a smile:\r\nsome of the other birds tittered audibly.\r\n\r\n 
    `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,\r\n`was, that the
    best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'\r\n\r\n  `What IS a Caucus-race?'
    said Alice; not that she wanted much\r\nto know, but the Dodo had paused as if
    it thought that SOMEBODY\r\nought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to
    say anything.\r\n\r\n  `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to
    do it.'\r\n(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter\r\nday,
    I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\r\n\r\n  First it marked out a race-course,
    in a sort of circle, (`the\r\nexact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then
    all the party\r\nwere placed along the course, here and there.  There was no
    `One,\r\ntwo, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,\r\nand
    left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know\r\nwhen the race was
    over.  However, when they had been running half\r\nan hour or so, and were quite
    dry again, the Dodo suddenly called\r\nout `The race is over!' and they all crowded
    round it, panting,\r\nand asking, `But who has won?'\r\n\r\n  This question the
    Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\r\nthought, and it sat for a long
    time with one finger pressed upon\r\nits forehead (the position in which you
    usually see Shakespeare,\r\nin the pictures of him), while the rest waited in
    silence.  At\r\nlast the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have\r\nprizes.'\r\n\r\n 
    `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n 
    `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with\r\none finger; and
    the whole party at once crowded round her,\r\ncalling out in a confused way,
    `Prizes! Prizes!'\r\n\r\n  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put
    her hand\r\nin her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt\r\nwater
    had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.\r\nThere was exactly one
    a-piece all round.\r\n\r\n  `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said
    the Mouse.\r\n\r\n  `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely.  `What else have\r\nyou
    got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Only a thimble,'
    said Alice sadly.\r\n\r\n  `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.\r\n\r\n  Then
    they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo\r\nsolemnly presented the
    thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of\r\nthis elegant thimble'; and, when
    it had finished this short\r\nspeech, they all cheered.\r\n\r\n  Alice thought
    the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked\r\nso grave that she did not
    dare to laugh; and, as she could not\r\nthink of anything to say, she simply
    bowed, and took the thimble,\r\nlooking as solemn as she could.\r\n\r\n  The
    next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noise\r\nand confusion,
    as the large birds complained that they could not\r\ntaste theirs, and the small
    ones choked and had to be patted on\r\nthe back.  However, it was over at last,
    and they sat down again\r\nin a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something
    more.\r\n\r\n  `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,\r\n`and
    why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half\r\nafraid that it
    would be offended again.\r\n\r\n  `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse,
    turning to\r\nAlice, and sighing.\r\n\r\n  `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said
    Alice, looking down with\r\nwonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call
    it sad?'  And\r\nshe kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking,
    so\r\nthat her idea of the tale was something like this:--\r\n\r\n                   
    `Fury said to a\r\n                   mouse, That he\r\n                 met
    in the\r\n               house,\r\n            \"Let us\r\n              both
    go to\r\n                law:  I will\r\n                  prosecute\r\n                   
    YOU.  --Come,\r\n                       I'll take no\r\n                       
    denial; We\r\n                     must have a\r\n                 trial:  For\r\n             
    really this\r\n           morning I've\r\n          nothing\r\n         to do.\"\r\n          
    Said the\r\n             mouse to the\r\n               cur, \"Such\r\n

    be\r\n                 judge, I'll\r\n                   be jury,\"\r\n                        
    Said\r\n                    cunning\r\n                      old Fury:\r\n                    
    \"I'll\r\n                      try the\r\n                         whole\r\n

    `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.\r\n`What are you thinking
    of?'\r\n\r\n  `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly:  `you had got to\r\nthe
    fifth bend, I think?'\r\n\r\n  `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very
    angrily.\r\n\r\n  `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful,
    and\r\nlooking anxiously about her.  `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'\r\n\r\n 
    `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up\r\nand walking away. 
    `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'\r\n\r\n  `I didn't mean it!' pleaded
    poor Alice.  `But you're so easily\r\noffended, you know!'\r\n\r\n  The Mouse
    only growled in reply.\r\n\r\n  `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice
    called after\r\nit; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but\r\nthe
    Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little\r\nquicker.\r\n\r\n 
    `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it\r\nwas quite out
    of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of\r\nsaying to her daughter `Ah,
    my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you\r\nnever to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your
    tongue, Ma!' said the\r\nyoung Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to
    try the\r\npatience of an oyster!'\r\n\r\n  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know
    I do!' said Alice aloud,\r\naddressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch
    it back!'\r\n\r\n  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'\r\nsaid
    the Lory.\r\n\r\n  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about\r\nher
    pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And she's such a capital one for\r\ncatching mice you
    can't think!  And oh, I wish you could see her\r\nafter the birds!  Why, she'll
    eat a little bird as soon as look\r\nat it!'\r\n\r\n  This speech caused a remarkable
    sensation among the party.\r\nSome of the birds hurried off at once:  one the
    old Magpie began\r\nwrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must
    be\r\ngetting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary\r\ncalled
    out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my\r\ndears!  It's high
    time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts\r\nthey all moved off, and Alice
    was soon left alone.\r\n\r\n  `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to
    herself in a\r\nmelancholy tone.  `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm\r\nsure
    she's the best cat in the world!  Oh, my dear Dinah!  I\r\nwonder if I shall
    ever see you any more!'  And here poor Alice\r\nbegan to cry again, for she felt
    very lonely and low-spirited.\r\nIn a little while, however, she again heard
    a little pattering of\r\nfootsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly,
    half hoping\r\nthat the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to\r\nfinish
    his story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n               
    The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n  It was the White Rabbit, trotting
    slowly back again, and\r\nlooking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost
    something;\r\nand she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!  The Duchess!\r\nOh
    my dear paws!  Oh my fur and whiskers!  She'll get me\r\nexecuted, as sure as
    ferrets are ferrets!  Where CAN I have\r\ndropped them, I wonder?'  Alice guessed
    in a moment that it was\r\nlooking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,
    and she\r\nvery good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were\r\nnowhere
    to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her\r\nswim in the pool,
    and the great hall, with the glass table and\r\nthe little door, had vanished
    completely.\r\n\r\n  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting
    about,\r\nand called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE\r\nyou
    doing out here?  Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of\r\ngloves and a
    fan!  Quick, now!'  And Alice was so much frightened\r\nthat she ran off at once
    in the direction it pointed to, without\r\ntrying to explain the mistake it had
    made.\r\n\r\n  `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.\r\n`How
    surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!  But I'd\r\nbetter take him his
    fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'\r\nAs she said this, she came upon
    a neat little house, on the door\r\nof which was a bright brass plate with the
    name `W. RABBIT'\r\nengraved upon it.  She went in without knocking, and hurried\r\nupstairs,
    in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,\r\nand be turned out of
    the house before she had found the fan and\r\ngloves.\r\n\r\n  `How queer it
    seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going\r\nmessages for a rabbit!  I suppose
    Dinah'll be sending me on\r\nmessages next!'  And she began fancying the sort
    of thing that\r\nwould happen:  `\"Miss Alice!  Come here directly, and get ready\r\nfor
    your walk!\" \"Coming in a minute, nurse!  But I've got to see\r\nthat the mouse
    doesn't get out.\"  Only I don't think,' Alice went\r\non, `that they'd let Dinah
    stop in the house if it began ordering\r\npeople about like that!'\r\n\r\n  By
    this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with\r\na table in the
    window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two\r\nor three pairs of tiny
    white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and\r\na pair of the gloves, and was just
    going to leave the room, when\r\nher eye fell upon a little bottle that stood
    near the looking-\r\nglass.  There was no label this time with the words `DRINK
    ME,'\r\nbut nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.  `I know\r\nSOMETHING
    interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,\r\n`whenever I eat or drink
    anything; so I'll just see what this\r\nbottle does.  I do hope it'll make me
    grow large again, for\r\nreally I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'\r\n\r\n 
    It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:\r\nbefore she had drunk
    half the bottle, she found her head pressing\r\nagainst the ceiling, and had
    to stoop to save her neck from being\r\nbroken.  She hastily put down the bottle,
    saying to herself\r\n`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As
    it is, I\r\ncan't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so\r\nmuch!'\r\n\r\n 
    Alas! it was too late to wish that!  She went on growing, and\r\ngrowing, and
    very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  in\r\nanother minute there was not
    even room for this, and she tried\r\nthe effect of lying down with one elbow
    against the door, and the\r\nother arm curled round her head.  Still she went
    on growing, and,\r\nas a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and
    one\r\nfoot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,\r\nwhatever
    happens.  What WILL become of me?'\r\n\r\n  Luckily for Alice, the little magic
    bottle had now had its full\r\neffect, and she grew no larger:  still it was
    very uncomfortable,\r\nand, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever
    getting\r\nout of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\r\n\r\n  `It was
    much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one\r\nwasn't always growing
    larger and smaller, and being ordered about\r\nby mice and rabbits.  I almost
    wish I hadn't gone down that\r\nrabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious,
    you know,\r\nthis sort of life!  I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!\r\nWhen
    I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing\r\nnever happened, and
    now here I am in the middle of one!  There\r\nought to be a book written about
    me, that there ought!  And when\r\nI grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up
    now,' she added in a\r\nsorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up
    any more\r\nHERE.'\r\n\r\n  `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any
    older than I\r\nam now?  That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman-\r\n-but
    then--always to have lessons to learn!  Oh, I shouldn't like\r\nTHAT!'\r\n\r\n 
    `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself.  `How can you\r\nlearn lessons
    in here?  Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no\r\nroom at all for any lesson-books!'\r\n\r\n 
    And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,\r\nand making quite
    a conversation of it altogether; but after a few\r\nminutes she heard a voice
    outside, and stopped to listen.\r\n\r\n  `Mary Ann!  Mary Ann!' said the voice. 
    `Fetch me my gloves\r\nthis moment!'  Then came a little pattering of feet on
    the\r\nstairs.  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and\r\nshe
    trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she\r\nwas now about
    a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no\r\nreason to be afraid of
    it.\r\n\r\n  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;\r\nbut,
    as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed\r\nhard against it,
    that attempt proved a failure.  Alice heard it\r\nsay to itself `Then I'll go
    round and get in at the window.'\r\n\r\n  `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and,
    after waiting till she\r\nfancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window,
    she suddenly\r\nspread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.  She did not\r\nget
    hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,\r\nand a crash of
    broken glass, from which she concluded that it was\r\njust possible it had fallen
    into a cucumber-frame, or something\r\nof the sort.\r\n\r\n  Next came an angry
    voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat!  Where are\r\nyou?'  And then a voice she had
    never heard before, `Sure then\r\nI'm here!  Digging for apples, yer honour!'\r\n\r\n 
    `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily.  `Here!\r\nCome and help
    me out of THIS!'  (Sounds of more broken glass.)\r\n\r\n  `Now tell me, Pat,
    what's that in the window?'\r\n\r\n  `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!'  (He pronounced
    it `arrum.')\r\n\r\n  `An arm, you goose!   Who ever saw one that size?  Why,
    it\r\nfills the whole window!'\r\n\r\n  `Sure, it does, yer honour:  but it's
    an arm for all that.'\r\n\r\n  `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: 
    go and take it\r\naway!'\r\n\r\n  There was a long silence after this, and Alice
    could only hear\r\nwhispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer\r\nhonour,
    at all, at all!'  `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at\r\nlast she spread out
    her hand again, and made another snatch in\r\nthe air.  This time there were
    TWO little shrieks, and more\r\nsounds of broken glass.  `What a number of cucumber-frames
    there\r\nmust be!' thought Alice.  `I wonder what they'll do next!  As for\r\npulling
    me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!  I'm sure I\r\ndon't want to stay
    in here any longer!'\r\n\r\n  She waited for some time without hearing anything
    more:  at\r\nlast came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a\r\ngood
    many voice all talking together:  she made out the words:\r\n`Where's the other
    ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;\r\nBill's got the other--Bill! fetch
    it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up\r\nat this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they
    don't reach half\r\nhigh enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular-\r\n-Here,
    Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind\r\nthat loose slate--Oh,
    it's coming down!  Heads below!' (a loud\r\ncrash)--`Now, who did that?--It was
    Bill, I fancy--Who's to go\r\ndown the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That
    I won't,\r\nthen!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to\r\ngo
    down the chimney!'\r\n\r\n  `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has
    he?' said\r\nAlice to herself.  `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!\r\nI
    wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal:  this fireplace is\r\nnarrow, to
    be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'\r\n\r\n  She drew her foot as far
    down the chimney as she could, and\r\nwaited till she heard a little animal (she
    couldn't guess of what\r\nsort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the
    chimney close\r\nabove her:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave
    one\r\nsharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.\r\n\r\n  The first
    thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes\r\nBill!' then the Rabbit's
    voice along--`Catch him, you by the\r\nhedge!' then silence, and then another
    confusion of voices--`Hold\r\nup his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was
    it, old fellow?\r\nWhat happened to you?  Tell us all about it!'\r\n\r\n  Last
    came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'\r\nthought Alice,) `Well,
    I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm\r\nbetter now--but I'm a deal too flustered
    to tell you--all I know\r\nis, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box,
    and up I goes\r\nlike a sky-rocket!'\r\n\r\n  `So you did, old fellow!' said
    the others.\r\n\r\n  `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice;
    and\r\nAlice called out as loud as she could, `If you do.  I'll set\r\nDinah
    at you!'\r\n\r\n  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to\r\nherself,
    `I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any\r\nsense, they'd take the
    roof off.'  After a minute or two, they\r\nbegan moving about again, and Alice
    heard the Rabbit say, `A\r\nbarrowful will do, to begin with.'\r\n\r\n  `A barrowful
    of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to\r\ndoubt, for the next moment
    a shower of little pebbles came\r\nrattling in at the window, and some of them
    hit her in the face.\r\n`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted
    out,\r\n`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all\r\nturning into little
    cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright\r\nidea came into her head.  `If
    I eat one of these cakes,' she\r\nthought, `it's sure to make SOME change in
    my size; and as it\r\ncan't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller,
    I\r\nsuppose.'\r\n\r\n  So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted
    to find\r\nthat she began shrinking directly.  As soon as she was small\r\nenough
    to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and\r\nfound quite a crowd
    of little animals and birds waiting outside.\r\nThe poor little Lizard, Bill,
    was in the middle, being held up by\r\ntwo guinea-pigs, who were giving it something
    out of a bottle.\r\nThey all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but
    she\r\nran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a\r\nthick
    wood.\r\n\r\n  `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she\r\nwandered
    about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;\r\nand the second thing
    is to find my way into that lovely garden.\r\nI think that will be the best plan.'\r\n\r\n 
    It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and\r\nsimply arranged;
    the only difficulty was, that she had not the\r\nsmallest idea how to set about
    it; and while she was peering\r\nabout anxiously among the trees, a little sharp
    bark just over\r\nher head made her look up in a great hurry.\r\n\r\n  An enormous
    puppy was looking down at her with large round\r\neyes, and feebly stretching
    out one paw, trying to touch her.\r\n`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing
    tone, and she tried\r\nhard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened
    all the\r\ntime at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it\r\nwould
    be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\r\n\r\n  Hardly knowing
    what she did, she picked up a little bit of\r\nstick, and held it out to the
    puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped\r\ninto the air off all its feet at once, with
    a yelp of delight,\r\nand rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it;
    then Alice\r\ndodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run\r\nover;
    and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy\r\nmade another rush
    at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in\r\nits hurry to get hold of it;
    then Alice, thinking it was very\r\nlike having a game of play with a cart-horse,
    and expecting every\r\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle\r\nagain;
    then the puppy began a series of short charges at the\r\nstick, running a very
    little way forwards each time and a long\r\nway back, and barking hoarsely all
    the while, till at last it sat\r\ndown a good way off, panting, with its tongue
    hanging out of its\r\nmouth, and its great eyes half shut.\r\n\r\n  This seemed
    to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;\r\nso she set off at once,
    and ran till she was quite tired and out\r\nof breath, and till the puppy's bark
    sounded quite faint in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n  `And yet what a dear little
    puppy it was!' said Alice, as she\r\nleant against a buttercup to rest herself,
    and fanned herself\r\nwith one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching
    it tricks\r\nvery much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!  Oh\r\ndear! 
    I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!  Let\r\nme see--how IS it
    to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or\r\ndrink something or other; but
    the great question is, what?'\r\n\r\n  The great question certainly was, what? 
    Alice looked all round\r\nher at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she
    did not see\r\nanything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under\r\nthe
    circumstances.  There was a large mushroom growing near her,\r\nabout the same
    height as herself; and when she had looked under\r\nit, and on both sides of
    it, and behind it, it occurred to her\r\nthat she might as well look and see
    what was on the top of it.\r\n\r\n  She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped
    over the edge of\r\nthe mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large\r\ncaterpillar,
    that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,\r\nquietly smoking a long hookah,
    and taking not the smallest notice\r\nof her or of anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           
    CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                    Advice from a Caterpillar\r\n\r\n\r\n  The
    Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\r\nsilence:  at last
    the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its\r\nmouth, and addressed her in a languid,
    sleepy voice.\r\n\r\n  `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  This was
    not an encouraging opening for a conversation.  Alice\r\nreplied, rather shyly,
    `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--\r\nat least I know who I WAS when I
    got up this morning, but I think\r\nI must have been changed several times since
    then.'\r\n\r\n  `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.\r\n`Explain
    yourself!'\r\n\r\n  `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because\r\nI'm
    not myself, you see.'\r\n\r\n  `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n 
    `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very\r\npolitely, `for
    I can't understand it myself to begin with; and\r\nbeing so many different sizes
    in a day is very confusing.'\r\n\r\n  `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n 
    `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but\r\nwhen you have
    to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you\r\nknow--and then after that
    into a butterfly, I should think you'll\r\nfeel it a little queer, won't you?'\r\n\r\n 
    `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  `Well, perhaps your feelings may
    be different,' said Alice;\r\n`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'\r\n\r\n 
    `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously.  `Who are YOU?'\r\n\r\n  Which brought
    them back again to the beginning of the\r\nconversation.  Alice felt a little
    irritated at the Caterpillar's\r\nmaking such VERY short remarks, and she drew
    herself up and said,\r\nvery gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU
    are, first.'\r\n\r\n  `Why?' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  Here was another
    puzzling question; and as Alice could not\r\nthink of any good reason, and as
    the Caterpillar seemed to be in\r\na VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned
    away.\r\n\r\n  `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her.  `I've something\r\nimportant
    to say!'\r\n\r\n  This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n 
    `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  `Is that all?' said Alice,
    swallowing down her anger as well as\r\nshe could.\r\n\r\n  `No,' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else\r\nto do, and perhaps
    after all it might tell her something worth\r\nhearing.  For some minutes it
    puffed away without speaking, but\r\nat last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah
    out of its mouth\r\nagain, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'\r\n\r\n 
    `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as\r\nI used--and
    I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'\r\n\r\n  `Can't remember
    WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  `Well, I've tried to say \"HOW DOTH
    THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,\" but it\r\nall came different!' Alice replied in a very
    melancholy voice.\r\n\r\n  `Repeat, \"YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\"' said the
    Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  Alice folded her hands, and began:--\r\n\r\n    `You are
    old, Father William,' the young man said,\r\n      `And your hair has become
    very white;\r\n    And yet you incessantly stand on your head--\r\n      Do you
    think, at your age, it is right?'\r\n\r\n    `In my youth,' Father William replied
    to his son,\r\n      `I feared it might injure the brain;\r\n    But, now that
    I'm perfectly sure I have none,\r\n      Why, I do it again and again.'\r\n\r\n   
    `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,\r\n      And have grown
    most uncommonly fat;\r\n    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--\r\n     
    Pray, what is the reason of that?'\r\n\r\n    `In my youth,' said the sage, as
    he shook his grey locks,\r\n      `I kept all my limbs very supple\r\n    By
    the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--\r\n      Allow me to sell you
    a couple?'\r\n\r\n    `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak\r\n     
    For anything tougher than suet;\r\n    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones
    and the beak--\r\n      Pray how did you manage to do it?'\r\n\r\n    `In my
    youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,\r\n      And argued each case with
    my wife;\r\n    And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\r\n     
    Has lasted the rest of my life.'\r\n\r\n    `You are old,' said the youth, `one
    would hardly suppose\r\n      That your eye was as steady as ever;\r\n    Yet
    you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--\r\n      What made you so awfully
    clever?'\r\n\r\n    `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'\r\n     
    Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!\r\n    Do you think I can listen
    all day to such stuff?\r\n      Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'\r\n\r\n\r\n 
    `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  `Not QUITE right, I'm
    afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the\r\nwords have got altered.'\r\n\r\n 
    `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar\r\ndecidedly, and there
    was silence for some minutes.\r\n\r\n  The Caterpillar was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n 
    `What size do you want to be?' it asked.\r\n\r\n  `Oh, I'm not particular as
    to size,' Alice hastily replied;\r\n`only one doesn't like changing so often,
    you know.'\r\n\r\n  `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  Alice said
    nothing:  she had never been so much contradicted in\r\nher life before, and
    she felt that she was losing her temper.\r\n\r\n  `Are you content now?' said
    the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if
    you\r\nwouldn't mind,' said Alice:  `three inches is such a wretched\r\nheight
    to be.'\r\n\r\n  `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar\r\nangrily,
    rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three\r\ninches high).\r\n\r\n 
    `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.\r\nAnd she thought
    of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so\r\neasily offended!'\r\n\r\n 
    `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it\r\nput the hookah
    into its mouth and began smoking again.\r\n\r\n  This time Alice waited patiently
    until it chose to speak again.\r\nIn a minute or two the Caterpillar took the
    hookah out of its\r\nmouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.  Then
    it got\r\ndown off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely\r\nremarking
    as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and\r\nthe other side will make
    you grow shorter.'\r\n\r\n  `One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT?' thought
    Alice to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n  `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as
    if she had\r\nasked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a\r\nminute, trying to
    make out which were the two sides of it; and as\r\nit was perfectly round, she
    found this a very difficult question.\r\nHowever, at last she stretched her arms
    round it as far as they\r\nwould go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each
    hand.\r\n\r\n  `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a\r\nlittle
    of the right-hand bit to try the effect:  the next moment\r\nshe felt a violent
    blow underneath her chin:  it had struck her\r\nfoot!\r\n\r\n  She was a good
    deal frightened by this very sudden change, but\r\nshe felt that there was no
    time to be lost, as she was shrinking\r\nrapidly; so she set to work at once
    to eat some of the other bit.\r\nHer chin was pressed so closely against her
    foot, that there was\r\nhardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last,
    and\r\nmanaged to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *      
    *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n         *       *       *      
    *       *       *\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *       *      
    *\r\n\r\n  `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of\r\ndelight,
    which changed into alarm in another moment, when she\r\nfound that her shoulders
    were nowhere to be found:  all she could\r\nsee, when she looked down, was an
    immense length of neck, which\r\nseemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of
    green leaves that lay\r\nfar below her.\r\n\r\n  `What CAN all that green stuff
    be?' said Alice.  `And where\r\nHAVE my shoulders got to?  And oh, my poor hands,
    how is it I\r\ncan't see you?'  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no\r\nresult
    seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the\r\ndistant green leaves.\r\n\r\n 
    As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her\r\nhead, she tried
    to get her head down to them, and was delighted\r\nto find that her neck would
    bend about easily in any direction,\r\nlike a serpent.  She had just succeeded
    in curving it down into a\r\ngraceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among
    the leaves, which\r\nshe found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under
    which she\r\nhad been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a\r\nhurry: 
    a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating\r\nher violently with
    its wings.\r\n\r\n  `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.\r\n\r\n  `I'm NOT a serpent!'
    said Alice indignantly.  `Let me alone!'\r\n\r\n  `Serpent, I say again!' repeated
    the Pigeon, but in a more\r\nsubdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've
    tried every\r\nway, and nothing seems to suit them!'\r\n\r\n  `I haven't the
    least idea what you're talking about,' said\r\nAlice.\r\n\r\n  `I've tried the
    roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've\r\ntried hedges,' the Pigeon went
    on, without attending to her; `but\r\nthose serpents!  There's no pleasing them!'\r\n\r\n 
    Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no\r\nuse in saying
    anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\r\n\r\n  `As if it wasn't trouble
    enough hatching the eggs,' said the\r\nPigeon; `but I must be on the look-out
    for serpents night and\r\nday!  Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three
    weeks!'\r\n\r\n  `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was\r\nbeginning
    to see its meaning.\r\n\r\n  `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,'
    continued\r\nthe Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was\r\nthinking
    I should be free of them at last, they must needs come\r\nwriggling down from
    the sky!  Ugh, Serpent!'\r\n\r\n  `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. 
    `I'm a--I'm\r\na--'\r\n\r\n  `Well!  WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon.  `I can
    see you're\r\ntrying to invent something!'\r\n\r\n  `I--I'm a little girl,' said
    Alice, rather doubtfully, as she\r\nremembered the number of changes she had
    gone through that day.\r\n\r\n  `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a
    tone of the\r\ndeepest contempt.  `I've seen a good many little girls in my\r\ntime,
    but never ONE with such a neck as that!  No, no!  You're a\r\nserpent; and there's
    no use denying it.  I suppose you'll be\r\ntelling me next that you never tasted
    an egg!'\r\n\r\n  `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very\r\ntruthful
    child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as\r\nserpents do, you know.'\r\n\r\n 
    `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why\r\nthen they're a
    kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'\r\n\r\n  This was such a new idea to
    Alice, that she was quite silent\r\nfor a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon
    the opportunity of\r\nadding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough;
    and\r\nwhat does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a\r\nserpent?'\r\n\r\n 
    `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm\r\nnot looking for
    eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't\r\nwant YOURS:  I don't like them
    raw.'\r\n\r\n  `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it\r\nsettled
    down again into its nest.  Alice crouched down among the\r\ntrees as well as
    she could, for her neck kept getting entangled\r\namong the branches, and every
    now and then she had to stop and\r\nuntwist it.  After a while she remembered
    that she still held the\r\npieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work
    very\r\ncarefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and\r\ngrowing
    sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\r\nsucceeded in bringing
    herself down to her usual height.\r\n\r\n  It was so long since she had been
    anything near the right size,\r\nthat it felt quite strange at first; but she
    got used to it in a\r\nfew minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. 
    `Come,\r\nthere's half my plan done now!  How puzzling all these changes\r\nare! 
    I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to\r\nanother!  However,
    I've got back to my right size:  the next\r\nthing is, to get into that beautiful
    garden--how IS that to be\r\ndone, I wonder?'  As she said this, she came suddenly
    upon an\r\nopen place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\r\n`Whoever
    lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come\r\nupon them THIS size: 
    why, I should frighten them out of their\r\nwits!'  So she began nibbling at
    the righthand bit again, and did\r\nnot venture to go near the house till she
    had brought herself\r\ndown to nine inches high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          
    CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                         Pig and Pepper\r\n\r\n\r\n  For a
    minute or two she stood looking at the house, and\r\nwondering what to do next,
    when suddenly a footman in livery came\r\nrunning out of the wood--(she considered
    him to be a footman\r\nbecause he was in livery:  otherwise, judging by his face
    only,\r\nshe would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door\r\nwith
    his knuckles.  It was opened by another footman in livery,\r\nwith a round face,
    and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,\r\nAlice noticed, had powdered
    hair that curled all over their\r\nheads.  She felt very curious to know what
    it was all about, and\r\ncrept a little way out of the wood to listen.\r\n\r\n 
    The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great\r\nletter, nearly
    as large as himself, and this he handed over to\r\nthe other, saying, in a solemn
    tone, `For the Duchess.  An\r\ninvitation from the Queen to play croquet.'  The
    Frog-Footman\r\nrepeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of
    the\r\nwords a little, `From the Queen.  An invitation for the Duchess\r\nto
    play croquet.'\r\n\r\n  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into\r\nthe wood for
    fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped\r\nout the Fish-Footman was
    gone, and the other was sitting on the\r\nground near the door, staring stupidly
    up into the sky.\r\n\r\n  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\r\n\r\n 
    `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and\r\nthat for two
    reasons.  First, because I'm on the same side of the\r\ndoor as you are; secondly,
    because they're making such a noise\r\ninside, no one could possibly hear you.' 
    And certainly there was\r\na most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant
    howling\r\nand sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish\r\nor
    kettle had been broken to pieces.\r\n\r\n  `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am
    I to get in?'\r\n\r\n  `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman
    went\r\non without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.  For\r\ninstance,
    if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let\r\nyou out, you know.' 
    He was looking up into the sky all the time\r\nhe was speaking, and this Alice
    thought decidedly uncivil.  `But\r\nperhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself;
    `his eyes are so\r\nVERY nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate he might\r\nanswer
    questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.\r\n\r\n  `I shall sit here,'
    the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'\r\n\r\n  At this moment the door of the
    house opened, and a large plate\r\ncame skimming out, straight at the Footman's
    head:  it just\r\ngrazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees\r\nbehind
    him.\r\n\r\n  `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,\r\nexactly
    as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n  `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again,
    in a louder tone.\r\n\r\n  `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman.  `That's
    the\r\nfirst question, you know.'\r\n\r\n  It was, no doubt:  only Alice did
    not like to be told so.\r\n`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the
    way all the\r\ncreatures argue.  It's enough to drive one crazy!'\r\n\r\n  The
    Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for\r\nrepeating his remark,
    with variations.  `I shall sit here,' he\r\nsaid, `on and off, for days and days.'\r\n\r\n 
    `But what am I to do?' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Anything you like,' said the Footman,
    and began whistling.\r\n\r\n  `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice
    desperately:\r\n`he's perfectly idiotic!'  And she opened the door and went in.\r\n\r\n 
    The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of\r\nsmoke from one
    end to the other:  the Duchess was sitting on a\r\nthree-legged stool in the
    middle, nursing a baby; the cook was\r\nleaning over the fire, stirring a large
    cauldron which seemed to\r\nbe full of soup.\r\n\r\n  `There's certainly too
    much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to\r\nherself, as well as she could for
    sneezing.\r\n\r\n  There was certainly too much of it in the air.  Even the\r\nDuchess
    sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was\r\nsneezing and howling alternately
    without a moment's pause.  The\r\nonly things in the kitchen that did not sneeze,
    were the cook,\r\nand a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning
    from\r\near to ear.\r\n\r\n  `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little
    timidly, for\r\nshe was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to\r\nspeak
    first, `why your cat grins like that?'\r\n\r\n  `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the
    Duchess, `and that's why.\r\nPig!'\r\n\r\n  She said the last word with such
    sudden violence that Alice\r\nquite jumped; but she saw in another moment that
    it was addressed\r\nto the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went
    on\r\nagain:--\r\n\r\n  `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in
    fact, I\r\ndidn't know that cats COULD grin.'\r\n\r\n  `They all can,' said the
    Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'\r\n\r\n  `I don't know of any that do,' Alice
    said very politely,\r\nfeeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.\r\n\r\n 
    `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'\r\n\r\n  Alice
    did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought\r\nit would be as well
    to introduce some other subject of\r\nconversation.  While she was trying to
    fix on one, the cook took\r\nthe cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set
    to work\r\nthrowing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby\r\n--the
    fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,\r\nplates, and dishes. 
    The Duchess took no notice of them even when\r\nthey hit her; and the baby was
    howling so much already, that it\r\nwas quite impossible to say whether the blows
    hurt it or not.\r\n\r\n  `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping
    up\r\nand down in an agony of terror.  `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS\r\nnose';
    as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very\r\nnearly carried it
    off.\r\n\r\n  `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a\r\nhoarse
    growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it\r\ndoes.'\r\n\r\n  `Which
    would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very\r\nglad to get an opportunity
    of showing off a little of her\r\nknowledge.  `Just think of what work it would
    make with the day\r\nand night!  You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to
    turn\r\nround on its axis--'\r\n\r\n  `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop
    off her head!'\r\n\r\n  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if
    she meant\r\nto take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and\r\nseemed
    not to be listening, so she went on again:  `Twenty-four\r\nhours, I THINK; or
    is it twelve?  I--'\r\n\r\n  `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never
    could abide\r\nfigures!'  And with that she began nursing her child again,\r\nsinging
    a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a\r\nviolent shake at the
    end of every line:\r\n\r\n        `Speak roughly to your little boy,\r\n         
    And beat him when he sneezes:\r\n        He only does it to annoy,\r\n         
    Because he knows it teases.'\r\n\r\n                    CHORUS.\r\n\r\n    (In
    which the cook and the baby joined):--\r\n\r\n                `Wow! wow! wow!'\r\n\r\n 
    While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept\r\ntossing the
    baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing\r\nhowled so, that Alice
    could hardly hear the words:--\r\n\r\n        `I speak severely to my boy,\r\n         
    I beat him when he sneezes;\r\n        For he can thoroughly enjoy\r\n         
    The pepper when he pleases!'\r\n\r\n                    CHORUS.\r\n\r\n               
    `Wow! wow! wow!'\r\n\r\n  `Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess
    said\r\nto Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.  `I must go and\r\nget
    ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of\r\nthe room.  The
    cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,\r\nbut it just missed her.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-\r\nshaped little
    creature, and held out its arms and legs in all\r\ndirections, `just like a star-fish,'
    thought Alice.  The poor\r\nlittle thing was snorting like a steam-engine when
    she caught it,\r\nand kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,\r\nso
    that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much\r\nas she could
    do to hold it.\r\n\r\n  As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing
    it,\r\n(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep\r\ntight
    hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its\r\nundoing itself,)
    she carried it out into the open air.  `IF I\r\ndon't take this child away with
    me,' thought Alice, `they're sure\r\nto kill it in a day or two:  wouldn't it
    be murder to leave it\r\nbehind?'  She said the last words out loud, and the
    little thing\r\ngrunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).  `Don't\r\ngrunt,'
    said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing\r\nyourself.'\r\n\r\n 
    The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into\r\nits face to see
    what was the matter with it.  There could be no\r\ndoubt that it had a VERY turn-up
    nose, much more like a snout\r\nthan a real nose; also its eyes were getting
    extremely small for\r\na baby:  altogether Alice did not like the look of the
    thing at\r\nall.  `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked\r\ninto
    its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.\r\n\r\n  No, there were no tears. 
    `If you're going to turn into a pig,\r\nmy dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll
    have nothing more to do\r\nwith you.  Mind now!'  The poor little thing sobbed
    again (or\r\ngrunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for\r\nsome
    while in silence.\r\n\r\n  Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now,
    what am I\r\nto do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted\r\nagain,
    so violently, that she looked down into its face in some\r\nalarm.  This time
    there could be NO mistake about it:  it was\r\nneither more nor less than a pig,
    and she felt that it would be\r\nquite absurd for her to carry it further.\r\n\r\n 
    So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to\r\nsee it trot
    away quietly into the wood.  `If it had grown up,'\r\nshe said to herself, `it
    would have made a dreadfully ugly child:\r\nbut it makes rather a handsome pig,
    I think.'  And she began\r\nthinking over other children she knew, who might
    do very well as\r\npigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the
    right\r\nway to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing\r\nthe
    Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.\r\n\r\n  The Cat only
    grinned when it saw Alice.  It looked good-\r\nnatured, she thought:  still it
    had VERY long claws and a great\r\nmany teeth, so she felt that it ought to be
    treated with respect.\r\n\r\n  `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as
    she did not at\r\nall know whether it would like the name:  however, it only\r\ngrinned
    a little wider.  `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought\r\nAlice, and she went
    on.  `Would you tell me, please, which way I\r\nought to go from here?'\r\n\r\n 
    `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said\r\nthe Cat.\r\n\r\n 
    `I don't much care where--' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Then it doesn't matter which
    way you go,' said the Cat.\r\n\r\n  `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added
    as an explanation.\r\n\r\n  `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you
    only walk\r\nlong enough.'\r\n\r\n  Alice felt that this could not be denied,
    so she tried another\r\nquestion.  `What sort of people live about here?'\r\n\r\n 
    `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,\r\n`lives a Hatter: 
    and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,\r\n`lives a March Hare.  Visit
    either you like:  they're both mad.'\r\n\r\n  `But I don't want to go among mad
    people,' Alice remarked.\r\n\r\n  `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat:  `we're
    all mad here.\r\nI'm mad.  You're mad.'\r\n\r\n  `How do you know I'm mad?' said
    Alice.\r\n\r\n  `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.'\r\n\r\n 
    Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on\r\n`And how do
    you know that you're mad?'\r\n\r\n  `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not
    mad.  You grant\r\nthat?'\r\n\r\n  `I suppose so,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Well,
    then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's\r\nangry, and wags its
    tail when it's pleased.  Now I growl when I'm\r\npleased, and wag my tail when
    I'm angry.  Therefore I'm mad.'\r\n\r\n  `I call it purring, not growling,' said
    Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Call it what you like,' said the Cat.  `Do you play croquet\r\nwith
    the Queen to-day?'\r\n\r\n  `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I
    haven't been\r\ninvited yet.'\r\n\r\n  `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and
    vanished.\r\n\r\n  Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used\r\nto
    queer things happening.  While she was looking at the place\r\nwhere it had been,
    it suddenly appeared again.\r\n\r\n  `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said
    the Cat.  `I'd\r\nnearly forgotten to ask.'\r\n\r\n  `It turned into a pig,'
    Alice quietly said, just as if it had\r\ncome back in a natural way.\r\n\r\n 
    `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.\r\n\r\n  Alice waited
    a little, half expecting to see it again, but it\r\ndid not appear, and after
    a minute or two she walked on in the\r\ndirection in which the March Hare was
    said to live.  `I've seen\r\nhatters before,' she said to herself; `the March
    Hare will be\r\nmuch the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't
    be\r\nraving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.'  As she said\r\nthis,
    she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a\r\nbranch of a tree.\r\n\r\n 
    `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.\r\n\r\n  `I said pig,' replied Alice;
    `and I wish you wouldn't keep\r\nappearing and vanishing so suddenly:  you make
    one quite giddy.'\r\n\r\n  `All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished
    quite\r\nslowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the\r\ngrin,
    which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.\r\n\r\n  `Well!  I've
    often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;\r\n`but a grin without a cat! 
    It's the most curious thing I ever\r\nsay in my life!'\r\n\r\n  She had not gone
    much farther before she came in sight of the\r\nhouse of the March Hare:  she
    thought it must be the right house,\r\nbecause the chimneys were shaped like
    ears and the roof was\r\nthatched with fur.  It was so large a house, that she
    did not\r\nlike to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand\r\nbit
    of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high:  even\r\nthen she walked
    up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself\r\n`Suppose it should be raving
    mad after all!  I almost wish I'd\r\ngone to see the Hatter instead!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          
    CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                         A Mad Tea-Party\r\n\r\n\r\n  There
    was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,\r\nand the March Hare
    and the Hatter were having tea at it:  a\r\nDormouse was sitting between them,
    fast asleep, and the other two\r\nwere using it as a cushion, resting their elbows
    on it, and the\r\ntalking over its head.  `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,'\r\nthought
    Alice; `only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'\r\n\r\n  The table
    was a large one, but the three were all crowded\r\ntogether at one corner of
    it:  `No room!  No room!' they cried\r\nout when they saw Alice coming.  `There's
    PLENTY of room!' said\r\nAlice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair
    at one\r\nend of the table.\r\n\r\n  `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in
    an encouraging tone.\r\n\r\n  Alice looked all round the table, but there was
    nothing on it\r\nbut tea.  `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.\r\n\r\n  `There
    isn't any,' said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n  `Then it wasn't very civil of you to
    offer it,' said Alice\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\n  `It wasn't very civil of you to sit
    down without being\r\ninvited,' said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n  `I didn't know
    it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a\r\ngreat many more than three.'\r\n\r\n 
    `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter.  He had been\r\nlooking at Alice
    for some time with great curiosity, and this was\r\nhis first speech.\r\n\r\n 
    `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said\r\nwith some severity;
    `it's very rude.'\r\n\r\n  The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this;
    but all\r\nhe SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'\r\n\r\n  `Come,
    we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice.  `I'm glad\r\nthey've begun asking
    riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she\r\nadded aloud.\r\n\r\n  `Do you mean
    that you think you can find out the answer to it?'\r\nsaid the March Hare.\r\n\r\n 
    `Exactly so,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Then you should say what you mean,' the March
    Hare went on.\r\n\r\n  `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean
    what\r\nI say--that's the same thing, you know.'\r\n\r\n  `Not the same thing
    a bit!' said the Hatter.  `You might just\r\nas well say that \"I see what I
    eat\" is the same thing as \"I eat\r\nwhat I see\"!'\r\n\r\n  `You might just
    as well say,' added the March Hare, `that \"I\r\nlike what I get\" is the same
    thing as \"I get what I like\"!'\r\n\r\n  `You might just as well say,' added
    the Dormouse, who seemed to\r\nbe talking in his sleep, `that \"I breathe when
    I sleep\" is the\r\nsame thing as \"I sleep when I breathe\"!'\r\n\r\n  `It IS
    the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the\r\nconversation dropped,
    and the party sat silent for a minute,\r\nwhile Alice thought over all she could
    remember about ravens and\r\nwriting-desks, which wasn't much.\r\n\r\n  The Hatter
    was the first to break the silence.  `What day of\r\nthe month is it?' he said,
    turning to Alice:  he had taken his\r\nwatch out of his pocket, and was looking
    at it uneasily, shaking\r\nit every now and then, and holding it to his ear.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'\r\n\r\n  `Two days wrong!'
    sighed the Hatter.  `I told you butter\r\nwouldn't suit the works!' he added
    looking angrily at the March\r\nHare.\r\n\r\n  `It was the BEST butter,' the
    March Hare meekly replied.\r\n\r\n  `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as
    well,' the Hatter\r\ngrumbled:  `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'\r\n\r\n 
    The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily:  then\r\nhe dipped it
    into his cup of tea, and looked at it again:  but he\r\ncould think of nothing
    better to say than his first remark, `It\r\nwas the BEST butter, you know.'\r\n\r\n 
    Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.\r\n`What a funny
    watch!' she remarked.  `It tells the day of the\r\nmonth, and doesn't tell what
    o'clock it is!'\r\n\r\n  `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter.  `Does YOUR watch
    tell\r\nyou what year it is?'\r\n\r\n  `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 
    `but that's\r\nbecause it stays the same year for such a long time together.'\r\n\r\n 
    `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.\r\n\r\n  Alice felt dreadfully
    puzzled.  The Hatter's remark seemed to\r\nhave no sort of meaning in it, and
    yet it was certainly English.\r\n`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as
    politely as she\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n  `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter,
    and he poured\r\na little hot tea upon its nose.\r\n\r\n  The Dormouse shook
    its head impatiently, and said, without\r\nopening its eyes, `Of course, of course;
    just what I was going to\r\nremark myself.'\r\n\r\n  `Have you guessed the riddle
    yet?' the Hatter said, turning to\r\nAlice again.\r\n\r\n  `No, I give it up,'
    Alice replied:  `what's the answer?'\r\n\r\n  `I haven't the slightest idea,'
    said the Hatter.\r\n\r\n  `Nor I,' said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n  Alice sighed
    wearily.  `I think you might do something better\r\nwith the time,' she said,
    `than waste it in asking riddles that\r\nhave no answers.'\r\n\r\n  `If you knew
    Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you\r\nwouldn't talk about wasting IT. 
    It's HIM.'\r\n\r\n  `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Of course
    you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head\r\ncontemptuously.  `I dare say
    you never even spoke to Time!'\r\n\r\n  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 
    `but I know I have to\r\nbeat time when I learn music.'\r\n\r\n  `Ah! that accounts
    for it,' said the Hatter.  `He won't stand\r\nbeating.  Now, if you only kept
    on good terms with him, he'd do\r\nalmost anything you liked with the clock. 
    For instance, suppose\r\nit were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin
    lessons:\r\nyou'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the\r\nclock
    in a twinkling!  Half-past one, time for dinner!'\r\n\r\n  (`I only wish it was,'
    the March Hare said to itself in a\r\nwhisper.)\r\n\r\n  `That would be grand,
    certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:\r\n`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for
    it, you know.'\r\n\r\n  `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter:  `but you could
    keep\r\nit to half-past one as long as you liked.'\r\n\r\n  `Is that the way
    YOU manage?' Alice asked.\r\n\r\n  The Hatter shook his head mournfully.  `Not
    I!' he replied.\r\n`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'\r\n(pointing
    with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the\r\ngreat concert given
    by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\r\n\r\n            \"Twinkle, twinkle,
    little bat!\r\n            How I wonder what you're at!\"\r\n\r\nYou know the
    song, perhaps?'\r\n\r\n  `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n 
    `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--\r\n\r\n           
    \"Up above the world you fly,\r\n            Like a tea-tray in the sky.\r\n                   
    Twinkle, twinkle--\"'\r\n\r\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing
    in its sleep\r\n`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that\r\nthey
    had to pinch it to make it stop.\r\n\r\n  `Well, I'd hardly finished the first
    verse,' said the Hatter,\r\n`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, \"He's
    murdering the\r\ntime!  Off with his head!\"'\r\n\r\n  `How dreadfully savage!'
    exclaimed Alice.\r\n\r\n  `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful
    tone,\r\n`he won't do a thing I ask!  It's always six o'clock now.'\r\n\r\n 
    A bright idea came into Alice's head.  `Is that the reason so\r\nmany tea-things
    are put out here?' she asked.\r\n\r\n  `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with
    a sigh:  `it's always\r\ntea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between
    whiles.'\r\n\r\n  `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.\r\n\r\n 
    `Exactly so,' said the Hatter:  `as the things get used up.'\r\n\r\n  `But what
    happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice\r\nventured to ask.\r\n\r\n 
    `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,\r\nyawning.  `I'm
    getting tired of this.  I vote the young lady\r\ntells us a story.'\r\n\r\n 
    `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at\r\nthe proposal.\r\n\r\n 
    `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.  `Wake up,\r\nDormouse!'  And they
    pinched it on both sides at once.\r\n\r\n  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 
    `I wasn't asleep,' he\r\nsaid in a hoarse, feeble voice:  `I heard every word
    you fellows\r\nwere saying.'\r\n\r\n  `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n 
    `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.\r\n\r\n  `And be quick about it,' added the
    Hatter, `or you'll be asleep\r\nagain before it's done.'\r\n\r\n  `Once upon
    a time there were three little sisters,' the\r\nDormouse began in a great hurry;
    `and their names were Elsie,\r\nLacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom
    of a well--'\r\n\r\n  `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a
    great\r\ninterest in questions of eating and drinking.\r\n\r\n  `They lived on
    treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a\r\nminute or two.\r\n\r\n  `They
    couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently\r\nremarked; `they'd have been
    ill.'\r\n\r\n  `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'\r\n\r\n  Alice
    tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways\r\nof living would
    be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went\r\non:  `But why did they live
    at the bottom of a well?'\r\n\r\n  `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said
    to Alice, very\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\n  `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in
    an offended tone, `so\r\nI can't take more.'\r\n\r\n  `You mean you can't take
    LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very\r\neasy to take MORE than nothing.'\r\n\r\n 
    `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Who's making personal remarks
    now?' the Hatter asked\r\ntriumphantly.\r\n\r\n  Alice did not quite know what
    to say to this:  so she helped\r\nherself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and
    then turned to the\r\nDormouse, and repeated her question.  `Why did they live
    at the\r\nbottom of a well?'\r\n\r\n  The Dormouse again took a minute or two
    to think about it, and\r\nthen said, `It was a treacle-well.'\r\n\r\n  `There's
    no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but\r\nthe Hatter and the
    March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse\r\nsulkily remarked, `If you can't
    be civil, you'd better finish the\r\nstory for yourself.'\r\n\r\n  `No, please
    go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt\r\nagain.  I dare say there
    may be ONE.'\r\n\r\n  `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.  However,
    he\r\nconsented to go on.  `And so these three little sisters--they\r\nwere learning
    to draw, you know--'\r\n\r\n  `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting
    her promise.\r\n\r\n  `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all
    this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n  `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter:  `let's
    all move\r\none place on.'\r\n\r\n  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse
    followed him:  the\r\nMarch Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather\r\nunwillingly
    took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the\r\nonly one who got any
    advantage from the change:  and Alice was a\r\ngood deal worse off than before,
    as the March Hare had just upset\r\nthe milk-jug into his plate.\r\n\r\n  Alice
    did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began\r\nvery cautiously: 
    `But I don't understand.  Where did they draw\r\nthe treacle from?'\r\n\r\n 
    `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so\r\nI should think
    you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,\r\nstupid?'\r\n\r\n  `But they
    were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not\r\nchoosing to notice this
    last remark.\r\n\r\n  `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'\r\n\r\n 
    This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse\r\ngo on for some
    time without interrupting it.\r\n\r\n  `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse
    went on, yawning and\r\nrubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and
    they drew\r\nall manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'\r\n\r\n 
    `Why with an M?' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Why not?' said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice was silent.\r\n\r\n  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and
    was going\r\noff into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up\r\nagain
    with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an\r\nM, such as mouse-traps,
    and the moon, and memory, and muchness--\r\nyou know you say things are \"much
    of a muchness\"--did you ever\r\nsee such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'\r\n\r\n 
    `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I\r\ndon't think--'\r\n\r\n 
    `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.\r\n\r\n  This piece of rudeness was
    more than Alice could bear:  she got\r\nup in great disgust, and walked off;
    the Dormouse fell asleep\r\ninstantly, and neither of the others took the least
    notice of her\r\ngoing, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that\r\nthey
    would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were\r\ntrying to put
    the Dormouse into the teapot.\r\n\r\n  `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!'
    said Alice as she\r\npicked her way through the wood.  `It's the stupidest tea-party
    I\r\never was at in all my life!'\r\n\r\n  Just as she said this, she noticed
    that one of the trees had a\r\ndoor leading right into it.  `That's very curious!'
    she thought.\r\n`But everything's curious today.  I think I may as well go in
    at\r\nonce.'  And in she went.\r\n\r\n  Once more she found herself in the long
    hall, and close to the\r\nlittle glass table.  `Now, I'll manage better this
    time,' she\r\nsaid to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and\r\nunlocking
    the door that led into the garden.  Then she went to\r\nwork nibbling at the
    mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her\r\npocked) till she was about a foot
    high:  then she walked down the\r\nlittle passage:  and THEN--she found herself
    at last in the\r\nbeautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool\r\nfountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         
    CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                   The Queen's Croquet-Ground\r\n\r\n\r\n 
    A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:  the\r\nroses growing
    on it were white, but there were three gardeners at\r\nit, busily painting them
    red.  Alice thought this a very curious\r\nthing, and she went nearer to watch
    them, and just as she came up\r\nto them she heard one of them say, `Look out
    now, Five!  Don't go\r\nsplashing paint over me like that!'\r\n\r\n  `I couldn't
    help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged\r\nmy elbow.'\r\n\r\n  On
    which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five!  Always\r\nlay the blame
    on others!'\r\n\r\n  `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five.  `I heard the Queen
    say only\r\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'\r\n\r\n  `What for?' said
    the one who had spoken first.\r\n\r\n  `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said
    Seven.\r\n\r\n  `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it\r\nwas
    for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'\r\n\r\n  Seven flung down
    his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all\r\nthe unjust things--' when his
    eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as\r\nshe stood watching them, and he checked
    himself suddenly:  the\r\nothers looked round also, and all of them bowed low.\r\n\r\n 
    `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are\r\npainting those
    roses?'\r\n\r\n  Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.  Two began in
    a\r\nlow voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to\r\nhave been
    a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;\r\nand if the Queen was
    to find it out, we should all have our heads\r\ncut off, you know.  So you see,
    Miss, we're doing our best, afore\r\nshe comes, to--'  At this moment Five, who
    had been anxiously\r\nlooking across the garden, called out `The Queen!  The
    Queen!'\r\nand the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon\r\ntheir
    faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice\r\nlooked round, eager
    to see the Queen.\r\n\r\n  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were
    all shaped\r\nlike the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and\r\nfeet
    at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were\r\nornamented all over with
    diamonds, and walked two and two, as the\r\nsoldiers did.  After these came the
    royal children; there were\r\nten of them, and the little dears came jumping
    merrily along hand\r\nin hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts. 
    Next\r\ncame the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice\r\nrecognised
    the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous\r\nmanner, smiling at
    everything that was said, and went by without\r\nnoticing her.  Then followed
    the Knave of Hearts, carrying the\r\nKing's crown on a crimson velvet cushion;
    and, last of all this\r\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on\r\nher face like
    the three gardeners, but she could not remember\r\nevery having heard of such
    a rule at processions; `and besides,\r\nwhat would be the use of a procession,'
    thought she, `if people\r\nhad all to lie down upon their faces, so that they
    couldn't see\r\nit?'  So she stood still where she was, and waited.\r\n\r\n 
    When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped\r\nand looked at
    her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'\r\nShe said it to the Knave of
    Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n  `Idiot!' said the Queen,
    tossing her head impatiently; and,\r\nturning to Alice, she went on, `What's
    your name, child?'\r\n\r\n  `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said
    Alice very\r\npolitely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack
    of\r\ncards, after all.  I needn't be afraid of them!'\r\n\r\n  `And who are
    THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three\r\ngardeners who were lying round
    the rosetree; for, you see, as\r\nthey were lying on their faces, and the pattern
    on their backs\r\nwas the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether\r\nthey
    were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her\r\nown children.\r\n\r\n 
    `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.\r\n`It's no business
    of MINE.'\r\n\r\n  The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at
    her\r\nfor a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!\r\nOff--'\r\n\r\n 
    `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the\r\nQueen was silent.\r\n\r\n 
    The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said\r\n`Consider, my dear: 
    she is only a child!'\r\n\r\n  The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said
    to the Knave\r\n`Turn them over!'\r\n\r\n  The Knave did so, very carefully,
    with one foot.\r\n\r\n  `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and
    the\r\nthree gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the\r\nKing,
    the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.\r\n\r\n  `Leave off that!'
    screamed the Queen.  `You make me giddy.'\r\nAnd then, turning to the rose-tree,
    she went on, `What HAVE you\r\nbeen doing here?'\r\n\r\n  `May it please your
    Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,\r\ngoing down on one knee as he spoke,
    `we were trying--'\r\n\r\n  `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining
    the\r\nroses.  `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,\r\nthree
    of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate\r\ngardeners, who
    ran to Alice for protection.\r\n\r\n  `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and
    she put them into a\r\nlarge flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers
    wandered\r\nabout for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly\r\nmarched
    off after the others.\r\n\r\n  `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.\r\n\r\n 
    `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers\r\nshouted in
    reply.\r\n\r\n  `That's right!' shouted the Queen.  `Can you play croquet?'\r\n\r\n 
    The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question\r\nwas evidently
    meant for her.\r\n\r\n  `Yes!' shouted Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Come on, then!' roared
    the Queen, and Alice joined the\r\nprocession, wondering very much what would
    happen next.\r\n\r\n  `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her
    side.\r\nShe was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously\r\ninto
    her face.\r\n\r\n  `Very,' said Alice:  `--where's the Duchess?'\r\n\r\n  `Hush! 
    Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  He\r\nlooked anxiously over his
    shoulder as he spoke, and then raised\r\nhimself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close
    to her ear, and\r\nwhispered `She's under sentence of execution.'\r\n\r\n  `What
    for?' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Did you say \"What a pity!\"?' the Rabbit asked.\r\n\r\n 
    `No, I didn't,' said Alice:  `I don't think it's at all a pity.\r\nI said \"What
    for?\"'\r\n\r\n  `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.  Alice gave
    a\r\nlittle scream of laughter.  `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a\r\nfrightened
    tone.  `The Queen will hear you!  You see, she came\r\nrather late, and the Queen
    said--'\r\n\r\n  `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,\r\nand
    people began running about in all directions, tumbling up\r\nagainst each other;
    however, they got settled down in a minute or\r\ntwo, and the game began.  Alice
    thought she had never seen such a\r\ncurious croquet-ground in her life; it was
    all ridges and\r\nfurrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live\r\nflamingoes,
    and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to\r\nstand on their hands and
    feet, to make the arches.\r\n\r\n  The chief difficulty Alice found at first
    was in managing her\r\nflamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,\r\ncomfortably
    enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,\r\nbut generally, just as
    she had got its neck nicely straightened\r\nout, and was going to give the hedgehog
    a blow with its head, it\r\nWOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,
    with such a\r\npuzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:\r\nand
    when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,\r\nit was very
    provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\r\nitself, and was in the act
    of crawling away:  besides all this,\r\nthere was generally a ridge or furrow
    in the way wherever she\r\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up
    soldiers\r\nwere always getting up and walking off to other parts of the\r\nground,
    Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very\r\ndifficult game indeed.\r\n\r\n 
    The players all played at once without waiting for turns,\r\nquarrelling all
    the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in\r\na very short time the Queen
    was in a furious passion, and went\r\nstamping about, and shouting `Off with
    his head!' or `Off with\r\nher head!' about once in a minute.\r\n\r\n  Alice
    began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not as\r\nyet had any dispute
    with the Queen, but she knew that it might\r\nhappen any minute, `and then,'
    thought she, `what would become of\r\nme?  They're dreadfully fond of beheading
    people here; the great\r\nwonder is, that there's any one left alive!'\r\n\r\n 
    She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering\r\nwhether she could
    get away without being seen, when she noticed a\r\ncurious appearance in the
    air:  it puzzled her very much at\r\nfirst, but, after watching it a minute or
    two, she made it out to\r\nbe a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire
    Cat:  now I\r\nshall have somebody to talk to.'\r\n\r\n  `How are you getting
    on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was\r\nmouth enough for it to speak with.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.  `It's no\r\nuse speaking
    to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at\r\nleast one of them.' 
    In another minute the whole head appeared,\r\nand then Alice put down her flamingo,
    and began an account of the\r\ngame, feeling very glad she had someone to listen
    to her.  The\r\nCat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight,
    and\r\nno more of it appeared.\r\n\r\n  `I don't think they play at all fairly,'
    Alice began, in rather\r\na complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully
    one can't\r\nhear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in\r\nparticular;
    at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and\r\nyou've no idea how confusing
    it is all the things being alive;\r\nfor instance, there's the arch I've got
    to go through next\r\nwalking about at the other end of the ground--and I should
    have\r\ncroqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it\r\nsaw
    mine coming!'\r\n\r\n  `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.\r\n\r\n 
    `Not at all,' said Alice:  `she's so extremely--'  Just then\r\nshe noticed that
    the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so\r\nshe went on, `--likely to win,
    that it's hardly worth while\r\nfinishing the game.'\r\n\r\n  The Queen smiled
    and passed on.\r\n\r\n  `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to
    Alice, and\r\nlooking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.\r\n\r\n  `It's
    a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me\r\nto introduce it.'\r\n\r\n 
    `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:  `however,\r\nit may kiss
    my hand if it likes.'\r\n\r\n  `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.\r\n\r\n  `Don't
    be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me\r\nlike that!'  He got
    behind Alice as he spoke.\r\n\r\n  `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.  `I've
    read that in\r\nsome book, but I don't remember where.'\r\n\r\n  `Well, it must
    be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and\r\nhe called the Queen, who was
    passing at the moment, `My dear!  I\r\nwish you would have this cat removed!'\r\n\r\n 
    The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great\r\nor small. 
    `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking\r\nround.\r\n\r\n  `I'll
    fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and\r\nhe hurried off.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game\r\nwas going on,
    as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,\r\nscreaming with passion.  She
    had already heard her sentence three\r\nof the players to be executed for having
    missed their turns, and\r\nshe did not like the look of things at all, as the
    game was in\r\nsuch confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or\r\nnot. 
    So she went in search of her hedgehog.\r\n\r\n  The hedgehog was engaged in a
    fight with another hedgehog,\r\nwhich seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity
    for croqueting one\r\nof them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that
    her\r\nflamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where\r\nAlice
    could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up\r\ninto a tree.\r\n\r\n 
    By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,\r\nthe fight was
    over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:\r\n`but it doesn't matter much,'
    thought Alice, `as all the arches\r\nare gone from this side of the ground.' 
    So she tucked it away\r\nunder her arm, that it might not escape again, and went
    back for\r\na little more conversation with her friend.\r\n\r\n  When she got
    back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to\r\nfind quite a large crowd collected
    round it:  there was a dispute\r\ngoing on between the executioner, the King,
    and the Queen, who\r\nwere all talking at once, while all the rest were quite
    silent,\r\nand looked very uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n  The moment Alice appeared,
    she was appealed to by all three to\r\nsettle the question, and they repeated
    their arguments to her,\r\nthough, as they all spoke at once, she found it very
    hard indeed\r\nto make out exactly what they said.\r\n\r\n  The executioner's
    argument was, that you couldn't cut off a\r\nhead unless there was a body to
    cut it off from:  that he had\r\nnever had to do such a thing before, and he
    wasn't going to begin\r\nat HIS time of life.\r\n\r\n  The King's argument was,
    that anything that had a head could be\r\nbeheaded, and that you weren't to talk
    nonsense.\r\n\r\n  The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about\r\nit
    in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.\r\n(It was this
    last remark that had made the whole party look so\r\ngrave and anxious.)\r\n\r\n 
    Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the\r\nDuchess: 
    you'd better ask HER about it.'\r\n\r\n  `She's in prison,' the Queen said to
    the executioner:  `fetch\r\nher here.'  And the executioner went off like an
    arrow.\r\n\r\n   The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,\r\nby
    the time he had come back with the Dutchess, it had entirely\r\ndisappeared;
    so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and\r\ndown looking for it, while
    the rest of the party went back to the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          
    CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                     The Mock Turtle's Story\r\n\r\n\r\n  `You
    can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old\r\nthing!' said the
    Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately\r\ninto Alice's, and they walked
    off together.\r\n\r\n  Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper,
    and\r\nthought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had\r\nmade
    her so savage when they met in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n  `When I'M a Duchess,' she
    said to herself, (not in a very\r\nhopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper
    in my kitchen AT\r\nALL.  Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper
    that\r\nmakes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at\r\nhaving
    found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them\r\nsour--and camomile
    that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar\r\nand such things that make children
    sweet-tempered.  I only wish\r\npeople knew that:  then they wouldn't be so stingy
    about it, you\r\nknow--'\r\n\r\n  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this
    time, and was a\r\nlittle startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.\r\n`You're
    thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you\r\nforget to talk.  I can't
    tell you just now what the moral of that\r\nis, but I shall remember it in a
    bit.'\r\n\r\n  `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.\r\n\r\n  `Tut,
    tut, child!' said the Duchess.  `Everything's got a\r\nmoral, if only you can
    find it.'  And she squeezed herself up\r\ncloser to Alice's side as she spoke.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice did not much like keeping so close to her:  first,\r\nbecause the Duchess
    was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was\r\nexactly the right height to rest
    her chin upon Alice's shoulder,\r\nand it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.  However,
    she did not\r\nlike to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.\r\n\r\n 
    `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of\r\nkeeping up the
    conversation a little.\r\n\r\n  `'Tis so,' said the Duchess:  `and the moral
    of that is--\"Oh,\r\n'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!\"'\r\n\r\n 
    `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody\r\nminding their
    own business!'\r\n\r\n  `Ah, well!  It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,\r\ndigging
    her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,\r\n`and the moral of
    THAT is--\"Take care of the sense, and the\r\nsounds will take care of themselves.\"'\r\n\r\n 
    `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n 
    `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your\r\nwaist,' the
    Duchess said after a pause:  `the reason is, that I'm\r\ndoubtful about the temper
    of your flamingo.  Shall I try the\r\nexperiment?'\r\n\r\n  `HE might bite,'
    Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all\r\nanxious to have the experiment
    tried.\r\n\r\n  `Very true,' said the Duchess:  `flamingoes and mustard both\r\nbite. 
    And the moral of that is--\"Birds of a feather flock\r\ntogether.\"'\r\n\r\n 
    `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.\r\n\r\n  `Right, as usual,' said
    the Duchess:  `what a clear way you\r\nhave of putting things!'\r\n\r\n  `It's
    a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Of course it is,' said the Duchess,
    who seemed ready to agree\r\nto everything that Alice said; `there's a large
    mustard-mine near\r\nhere.  And the moral of that is--\"The more there is of
    mine, the\r\nless there is of yours.\"'\r\n\r\n  `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice,
    who had not attended to this\r\nlast remark, `it's a vegetable.  It doesn't look
    like one, but it\r\nis.'\r\n\r\n  `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess;
    `and the moral of\r\nthat is--\"Be what you would seem to be\"--or if you'd like
    it put\r\nmore simply--\"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than\r\nwhat
    it might appear to others that what you were or might have\r\nbeen was not otherwise
    than what you had been would have appeared\r\nto them to be otherwise.\"'\r\n\r\n 
    `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very\r\npolitely, `if I
    had it written down:  but I can't quite follow it\r\nas you say it.'\r\n\r\n 
    `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess\r\nreplied, in a
    pleased tone.\r\n\r\n  `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than
    that,'\r\nsaid Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. 
    `I make you\r\na present of everything I've said as yet.'\r\n\r\n  `A cheap sort
    of present!' thought Alice.  `I'm glad they don't\r\ngive birthday presents like
    that!'  But she did not venture to\r\nsay it out loud.\r\n\r\n  `Thinking again?'
    the Duchess asked, with another dig of her\r\nsharp little chin.\r\n\r\n  `I've
    a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was\r\nbeginning to feel a little
    worried.\r\n\r\n  `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have
    to\r\nfly; and the m--'\r\n\r\n  But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's
    voice died\r\naway, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the\r\narm
    that was linked into hers began to tremble.  Alice looked up,\r\nand there stood
    the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,\r\nfrowning like a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\n 
    `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n 
    `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on\r\nthe ground
    as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,\r\nand that in about half
    no time!  Take your choice!'\r\n\r\n  The Duchess took her choice, and was gone
    in a moment.\r\n\r\n  `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and
    Alice\r\nwas too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her\r\nback
    to the croquet-ground.\r\n\r\n  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's
    absence,\r\nand were resting in the shade:  however, the moment they saw her,\r\nthey
    hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a\r\nmoment's delay
    would cost them their lives.\r\n\r\n  All the time they were playing the Queen
    never left off\r\nquarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with
    his\r\nhead!' or `Off with her head!'  Those whom she sentenced were\r\ntaken
    into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave\r\noff being arches
    to do this, so that by the end of half an hour\r\nor so there were no arches
    left, and all the players, except the\r\nKing, the Queen, and Alice, were in
    custody and under sentence of\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n  Then the Queen left off,
    quite out of breath, and said to\r\nAlice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'\r\n\r\n 
    `No,' said Alice.  `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'\r\n\r\n  `It's
    the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.\r\n\r\n  `I never saw
    one, or heard of one,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Come on, then,' said the Queen,
    `and he shall tell you his\r\nhistory,'\r\n\r\n  As they walked off together,
    Alice heard the King say in a low\r\nvoice, to the company generally, `You are
    all pardoned.'  `Come,\r\nTHAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she
    had felt quite\r\nunhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.\r\n\r\n 
    They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the\r\nsun.  (IF you
    don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)\r\n`Up, lazy thing!' said
    the Queen, `and take this young lady to\r\nsee the Mock Turtle, and to hear his
    history.  I must go back and\r\nsee after some executions I have ordered'; and
    she walked off,\r\nleaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.  Alice did not quite
    like\r\nthe look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would\r\nbe
    quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage\r\nQueen:  so she waited.\r\n\r\n 
    The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the\r\nQueen till she
    was out of sight:  then it chuckled.  `What fun!'\r\nsaid the Gryphon, half to
    itself, half to Alice.\r\n\r\n  `What IS the fun?' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Why,
    SHE,' said the Gryphon.  `It's all her fancy, that:  they\r\nnever executes nobody,
    you know.  Come on!'\r\n\r\n  `Everybody says \"come on!\" here,' thought Alice,
    as she went\r\nslowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life,\r\nnever!'\r\n\r\n 
    They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the\r\ndistance, sitting
    sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,\r\nas they came nearer, Alice
    could hear him sighing as if his heart\r\nwould break.  She pitied him deeply. 
    `What is his sorrow?' she\r\nasked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very
    nearly in the\r\nsame words as before, `It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't
    got\r\nno sorrow, you know.  Come on!'\r\n\r\n  So they went up to the Mock Turtle,
    who looked at them with\r\nlarge eyes full of tears, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n 
    `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to\r\nknow your history,
    she do.'\r\n\r\n  `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow\r\ntone: 
    `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've\r\nfinished.'\r\n\r\n 
    So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice\r\nthought to herself,
    `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he\r\ndoesn't begin.'  But she waited
    patiently.\r\n\r\n  `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I
    was\r\na real Turtle.'\r\n\r\n  These words were followed by a very long silence,
    broken only\r\nby an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and\r\nthe
    constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very\r\nnearly getting
    up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your\r\ninteresting story,' but she could
    not help thinking there MUST be\r\nmore to come, so she sat still and said nothing.\r\n\r\n 
    `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more\r\ncalmly, though
    still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to\r\nschool in the sea.  The master
    was an old Turtle--we used to call\r\nhim Tortoise--'\r\n\r\n  `Why did you call
    him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.\r\n\r\n  `We called him Tortoise
    because he taught us,' said the Mock\r\nTurtle angrily:  `really you are very
    dull!'\r\n\r\n  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\r\nquestion,'
    added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and\r\nlooked at poor Alice,
    who felt ready to sink into the earth.  At\r\nlast the Gryphon said to the Mock
    Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!\r\nDon't be all day about it!' and he went on
    in these words:\r\n\r\n  `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't
    believe\r\nit--'\r\n\r\n  `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.\r\n\r\n 
    `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n  `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon,
    before Alice could speak\r\nagain.  The Mock Turtle went on.\r\n\r\n  `We had
    the best of educations--in fact, we went to school\r\nevery day--'\r\n\r\n  `I'VE
    been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be\r\nso proud as all that.'\r\n\r\n 
    `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\r\n\r\n  `Yes,' said
    Alice, `we learned French and music.'\r\n\r\n  `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n 
    `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.\r\n\r\n  `Ah! then yours wasn't a really
    good school,' said the Mock\r\nTurtle in a tone of great relief.  `Now at OURS
    they had at the\r\nend of the bill, \"French, music, AND WASHING--extra.\"'\r\n\r\n 
    `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the\r\nbottom of the
    sea.'\r\n\r\n  `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a\r\nsigh. 
    `I only took the regular course.'\r\n\r\n  `What was that?' inquired Alice.\r\n\r\n 
    `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock\r\nTurtle replied;
    `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--\r\nAmbition, Distraction, Uglification,
    and Derision.'\r\n\r\n  `I never heard of \"Uglification,\"' Alice ventured to
    say.  `What\r\nis it?'\r\n\r\n  The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 
    `What!  Never\r\nheard of uglifying!' it exclaimed.  `You know what to beautify\r\nis,
    I suppose?'\r\n\r\n  `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully:  `it means--to--make--anything--\r\nprettier.'\r\n\r\n 
    `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to\r\nuglify is, you
    ARE a simpleton.'\r\n\r\n  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions
    about\r\nit, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you\r\nto
    learn?'\r\n\r\n  `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting\r\noff
    the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,\r\nwith Seaography: 
    then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old\r\nconger-eel, that used to come
    once a week:  HE taught us\r\nDrawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'\r\n\r\n 
    `What was THAT like?' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Well, I can't show it you myself,'
    the Mock Turtle said:  `I'm\r\ntoo stiff.  And the Gryphon never learnt it.'\r\n\r\n 
    `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon:  `I went to the Classics\r\nmaster, though. 
    He was an old crab, HE was.'\r\n\r\n  `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle
    said with a sigh:  `he\r\ntaught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'\r\n\r\n 
    `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;\r\nand both creatures
    hid their faces in their paws.\r\n\r\n  `And how many hours a day did you do
    lessons?' said Alice, in a\r\nhurry to change the subject.\r\n\r\n  `Ten hours
    the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the\r\nnext, and so on.'\r\n\r\n 
    `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.\r\n\r\n  `That's the reason they're called
    lessons,' the Gryphon\r\nremarked:  `because they lessen from day to day.'\r\n\r\n 
    This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a\r\nlittle before
    she made her next remark.  `Then the eleventh day\r\nmust have been a holiday?'\r\n\r\n 
    `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n  `And how did you manage on
    the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.\r\n\r\n  `That's enough about lessons,'
    the Gryphon interrupted in a\r\nvery decided tone:  `tell her something about
    the games now.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                     
    The Lobster Quadrille\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the
    back of one flapper\r\nacross his eyes.  He looked at Alice, and tried to speak,
    but for\r\na minute or two sobs choked his voice.  `Same as if he had a bone\r\nin
    his throat,' said the Gryphon:  and it set to work shaking him\r\nand punching
    him in the back.  At last the Mock Turtle recovered\r\nhis voice, and, with tears
    running down his cheeks, he went on\r\nagain:--\r\n\r\n  `You may not have lived
    much under the sea--' (`I haven't,'\r\nsaid Alice)--`and perhaps you were never
    even introduced to a lobster--'\r\n(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but
    checked herself hastily,\r\nand said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea
    what a delightful\r\nthing a Lobster Quadrille is!'\r\n\r\n  `No, indeed,' said
    Alice.  `What sort of a dance is it?'\r\n\r\n  `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you
    first form into a line along the\r\nsea-shore--'\r\n\r\n  `Two lines!' cried
    the Mock Turtle.  `Seals, turtles, salmon,\r\nand so on; then, when you've cleared
    all the jelly-fish out of\r\nthe way--'\r\n\r\n  `THAT generally takes some time,'
    interrupted the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n  `--you advance twice--'\r\n\r\n  `Each with
    a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n  `Of course,' the Mock Turtle
    said:  `advance twice, set to\r\npartners--'\r\n\r\n  `--change lobsters, and
    retire in same order,' continued the\r\nGryphon.\r\n\r\n  `Then, you know,' the
    Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'\r\n\r\n  `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon,
    with a bound into the air.\r\n\r\n  `--as far out to sea as you can--'\r\n\r\n 
    `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n  `Turn a somersault in the sea!'
    cried the Mock Turtle,\r\ncapering wildly about.\r\n\r\n  `Back to land again,
    and that's all the first figure,' said the\r\nMock Turtle, suddenly dropping
    his voice; and the two creatures,\r\nwho had been jumping about like mad things
    all this time, sat\r\ndown again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\r\n\r\n 
    `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.\r\n\r\n  `Would you like
    to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n  `Very much indeed,' said
    Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the\r\nGryphon. 
    `We can do without lobsters, you know.  Which shall\r\nsing?'\r\n\r\n  `Oh, YOU
    sing,' said the Gryphon.  `I've forgotten the words.'\r\n\r\n  So they began
    solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now\r\nand then treading on her
    toes when they passed too close, and\r\nwaving their forepaws to mark the time,
    while the Mock Turtle\r\nsang this, very slowly and sadly:--\r\n\r\n\r\n`\"Will
    you walk a little faster?\" said a whiting to a snail.\r\n\"There's a porpoise
    close behind us, and he's treading on my\r\n tail.\r\nSee how eagerly the lobsters
    and the turtles all advance!\r\nThey are waiting on the shingle--will you come
    and join the\r\ndance?\r\n\r\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, will
    you join the\r\ndance?\r\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you
    join the\r\ndance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You can really have no notion how delightful
    it will be\r\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to\r\n                                                     
    sea!\"\r\nBut the snail replied \"Too far, too far!\" and gave a look\r\n                                                      
    askance--\r\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the\r\n  
    dance.\r\n    Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join\r\n       
    the dance.\r\n    Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join\r\n       
    the dance.\r\n\r\n`\"What matters it how far we go?\" his scaly friend replied.\r\n\"There
    is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\r\nThe further off from England
    the nearer is to France--\r\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and
    join the dance.\r\n\r\n    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you
    join the\r\n         dance?\r\n    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you,
    won't you join the\r\n         dance?\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  `Thank you, it's a
    very interesting dance to watch,' said\r\nAlice, feeling very glad that it was
    over at last:  `and I do so\r\nlike that curious song about the whiting!'\r\n\r\n 
    `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've\r\nseen them, of
    course?'\r\n\r\n  `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she\r\nchecked
    herself hastily.\r\n\r\n  `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle,
    `but\r\nif you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're\r\nlike.'\r\n\r\n 
    `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully.  `They have their\r\ntails in their
    mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'\r\n\r\n  `You're wrong about the crumbs,'
    said the Mock Turtle:\r\n`crumbs would all wash off in the sea.  But they HAVE
    their tails\r\nin their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle\r\nyawned
    and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all\r\nthat,' he said to the
    Gryphon.\r\n\r\n  `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with\r\nthe
    lobsters to the dance.  So they got thrown out to sea.  So\r\nthey had to fall
    a long way.  So they got their tails fast in\r\ntheir mouths.  So they couldn't
    get them out again.  That's all.'\r\n\r\n  `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very
    interesting.  I never knew\r\nso much about a whiting before.'\r\n\r\n  `I can
    tell you more than that, if you like,' said the\r\nGryphon.  `Do you know why
    it's called a whiting?'\r\n\r\n  `I never thought about it,' said Alice.  `Why?'\r\n\r\n 
    `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very\r\nsolemnly.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice was thoroughly puzzled.  `Does the boots and shoes!' she\r\nrepeated in
    a wondering tone.\r\n\r\n  `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. 
    `I\r\nmean, what makes them so shiny?'\r\n\r\n  Alice looked down at them, and
    considered a little before she\r\ngave her answer.  `They're done with blacking,
    I believe.'\r\n\r\n  `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in
    a deep\r\nvoice, `are done with a whiting.  Now you know.'\r\n\r\n  `And what
    are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n  `Soles
    and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather\r\nimpatiently:  `any shrimp
    could have told you that.'\r\n\r\n  `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose
    thoughts were\r\nstill running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, \"Keep\r\nback,
    please:  we don't want YOU with us!\"'\r\n\r\n  `They were obliged to have him
    with them,' the Mock Turtle\r\nsaid:  `no wise fish would go anywhere without
    a porpoise.'\r\n\r\n  `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\r\n\r\n 
    `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle:  `why, if a fish came\r\nto ME, and told
    me he was going a journey, I should say \"With\r\nwhat porpoise?\"'\r\n\r\n 
    `Don't you mean \"purpose\"?' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `I mean what I say,' the Mock
    Turtle replied in an offended\r\ntone.  And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear
    some of YOUR\r\nadventures.'\r\n\r\n  `I could tell you my adventures--beginning
    from this morning,'\r\nsaid Alice a little timidly:  `but it's no use going back
    to\r\nyesterday, because I was a different person then.'\r\n\r\n  `Explain all
    that,' said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n  `No, no!  The adventures first,' said the
    Gryphon in an\r\nimpatient tone:  `explanations take such a dreadful time.'\r\n\r\n 
    So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when\r\nshe first saw
    the White Rabbit.  She was a little nervous about\r\nit just at first, the two
    creatures got so close to her, one on\r\neach side, and opened their eyes and
    mouths so VERY wide, but she\r\ngained courage as she went on.  Her listeners
    were perfectly\r\nquiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE
    OLD,\r\nFATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming\r\ndifferent,
    and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said\r\n`That's very curious.'\r\n\r\n 
    `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n  `It all
    came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated\r\nthoughtfully.  `I should like to
    hear her try and repeat\r\nsomething now.  Tell her to begin.'  He looked at
    the Gryphon as\r\nif he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.\r\n\r\n 
    `Stand up and repeat \"'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,\"' said\r\nthe Gryphon.\r\n\r\n 
    `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat\r\nlessons!' thought
    Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'\r\nHowever, she got up, and began
    to repeat it, but her head was so\r\nfull of the Lobster Quadrille, that she
    hardly knew what she was\r\nsaying, and the words came very queer indeed:--\r\n\r\n   
    `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\r\n    \"You have baked
    me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\"\r\n    As a duck with its eyelids, so he
    with his nose\r\n    Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'\r\n\r\n             
    [later editions continued as follows\r\n    When the sands are all dry, he is
    gay as a lark,\r\n    And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\r\n   
    But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\r\n    His voice has a timid
    and tremulous sound.]\r\n\r\n  `That's different from what I used to say when
    I was a child,'\r\nsaid the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n  `Well, I never heard it before,'
    said the Mock Turtle; `but it\r\nsounds uncommon nonsense.'\r\n\r\n  Alice said
    nothing; she had sat down with her face in her\r\nhands, wondering if anything
    would EVER happen in a natural way\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n  `I should like to have
    it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n  `She can't explain it,' said the
    Gryphon hastily.  `Go on with\r\nthe next verse.'\r\n\r\n  `But about his toes?'
    the Mock Turtle persisted.  `How COULD\r\nhe turn them out with his nose, you
    know?'\r\n\r\n  `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was\r\ndreadfully
    puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n  `Go
    on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently:\r\n`it begins \"I
    passed by his garden.\"'\r\n\r\n  Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt
    sure it would\r\nall come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--\r\n\r\n   
    `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\r\n    How the Owl and the
    Panther were sharing a pie--'\r\n\r\n        [later editions continued as follows\r\n   
    The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\r\n    While the Owl had the
    dish as its share of the treat.\r\n    When the pie was all finished, the Owl,
    as a boon,\r\n    Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\r\n    While the
    Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\r\n    And concluded the banquet--]\r\n\r\n 
    `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle\r\ninterrupted,
    `if you don't explain it as you go on?  It's by far\r\nthe most confusing thing
    I ever heard!'\r\n\r\n  `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: 
    and\r\nAlice was only too glad to do so.\r\n\r\n  `Shall we try another figure
    of the Lobster Quadrille?' the\r\nGryphon went on.  `Or would you like the Mock
    Turtle to sing you\r\na song?'\r\n\r\n  `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle
    would be so kind,'\r\nAlice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather\r\noffended
    tone, `Hm! No accounting for tastes!  Sing her \"Turtle\r\nSoup,\" will you,
    old fellow?'\r\n\r\n  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes\r\nchoked
    with sobs, to sing this:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\r\n   
    Waiting in a hot tureen!\r\n    Who for such dainties would not stoop?\r\n   
    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\r\n    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\r\n       
    Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\r\n        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\r\n    Soo--oop of
    the e--e--evening,\r\n        Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\r\n\r\n    `Beautiful
    Soup!  Who cares for fish,\r\n    Game, or any other dish?\r\n    Who would not
    give all else for two p\r\n    ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\r\n    Pennyworth
    only of beautiful Soup?\r\n        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\r\n        Beau--ootiful
    Soo--oop!\r\n    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\r\n        Beautiful, beauti--FUL
    SOUP!'\r\n\r\n  `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had\r\njust
    begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!'\r\nwas heard in the
    distance.\r\n\r\n  `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand,\r\nit
    hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.\r\n\r\n  `What trial is
    it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon\r\nonly answered `Come on!' and
    ran the faster, while more and more\r\nfaintly came, carried on the breeze that
    followed them, the\r\nmelancholy words:--\r\n\r\n    `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\r\n       
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER
    XI\r\n\r\n                      Who Stole the Tarts?\r\n\r\n\r\n  The King and
    Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when\r\nthey arrived, with a great
    crowd assembled about them--all sorts\r\nof little birds and beasts, as well
    as the whole pack of cards:\r\nthe Knave was standing before them, in chains,
    with a soldier on\r\neach side to guard him; and near the King was the White
    Rabbit,\r\nwith a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the\r\nother. 
    In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large\r\ndish of tarts upon
    it:  they looked so good, that it made Alice\r\nquite hungry to look at them--`I
    wish they'd get the trial done,'\r\nshe thought, `and hand round the refreshments!' 
    But there seemed\r\nto be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything
    about\r\nher, to pass away the time.\r\n\r\n  Alice had never been in a court
    of justice before, but she had\r\nread about them in books, and she was quite
    pleased to find that\r\nshe knew the name of nearly everything there.  `That's
    the\r\njudge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'\r\n\r\n  The
    judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown\r\nover the wig, (look
    at the frontispiece if you want to see how he\r\ndid it,) he did not look at
    all comfortable, and it was certainly\r\nnot becoming.\r\n\r\n  `And that's the
    jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve\r\ncreatures,' (she was obliged to
    say `creatures,' you see, because\r\nsome of them were animals, and some were
    birds,) `I suppose they\r\nare the jurors.'  She said this last word two or three
    times over\r\nto herself, being rather proud of it:  for she thought, and\r\nrightly
    too, that very few little girls of her age knew the\r\nmeaning of it at all. 
    However, `jury-men' would have done just\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n  The twelve jurors
    were all writing very busily on slates.\r\n`What are they doing?'  Alice whispered
    to the Gryphon.  `They\r\ncan't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's
    begun.'\r\n\r\n  `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in\r\nreply,
    `for fear they should forget them before the end of the\r\ntrial.'\r\n\r\n  `Stupid
    things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but\r\nshe stopped hastily,
    for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in\r\nthe court!' and the King put on
    his spectacles and looked\r\nanxiously round, to make out who was talking.\r\n\r\n 
    Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their\r\nshoulders, that
    all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'\r\non their slates, and she
    could even make out that one of them\r\ndidn't know how to spell `stupid,' and
    that he had to ask his\r\nneighbour to tell him.  `A nice muddle their slates'll
    be in\r\nbefore the trial's over!' thought Alice.\r\n\r\n  One of the jurors
    had a pencil that squeaked.  This of course,\r\nAlice could not stand, and she
    went round the court and got\r\nbehind him, and very soon found an opportunity
    of taking it\r\naway.  She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was\r\nBill,
    the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of\r\nit; so, after hunting
    all about for it, he was obliged to write\r\nwith one finger for the rest of
    the day; and this was of very\r\nlittle use, as it left no mark on the slate.\r\n\r\n 
    `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.\r\n\r\n  On this the White Rabbit
    blew three blasts on the trumpet, and\r\nthen unrolled the parchment scroll,
    and read as follows:--\r\n\r\n    `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\r\n         
    All on a summer day:\r\n      The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\r\n         
    And took them quite away!'\r\n\r\n  `Consider your verdict,' the King said to
    the jury.\r\n\r\n  `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted.  `There's\r\na
    great deal to come before that!'\r\n\r\n  `Call the first witness,' said the
    King; and the White Rabbit\r\nblew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out,
    `First\r\nwitness!'\r\n\r\n  The first witness was the Hatter.  He came in with
    a teacup in\r\none hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.  `I beg\r\npardon,
    your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in:  but I\r\nhadn't quite finished
    my tea when I was sent for.'\r\n\r\n  `You ought to have finished,' said the
    King.  `When did you\r\nbegin?'\r\n\r\n  The Hatter looked at the March Hare,
    who had followed him into\r\nthe court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.  `Fourteenth
    of March, I\r\nthink it was,' he said.\r\n\r\n  `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n 
    `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.\r\n\r\n  `Write that down,' the King said to
    the jury, and the jury\r\neagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates,
    and then\r\nadded them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.\r\n\r\n 
    `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.\r\n\r\n  `It isn't mine,' said
    the Hatter.\r\n\r\n  `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who\r\ninstantly
    made a memorandum of the fact.\r\n\r\n  `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added
    as an explanation;\r\n`I've none of my own.  I'm a hatter.'\r\n\r\n  Here the
    Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the\r\nHatter, who turned pale
    and fidgeted.\r\n\r\n  `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous,
    or\r\nI'll have you executed on the spot.'\r\n\r\n  This did not seem to encourage
    the witness at all:  he kept\r\nshifting from one foot to the other, looking
    uneasily at the\r\nQueen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his\r\nteacup
    instead of the bread-and-butter.\r\n\r\n  Just at this moment Alice felt a very
    curious sensation, which\r\npuzzled her a good deal until she made out what it
    was:  she was\r\nbeginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she\r\nwould
    get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she\r\ndecided to remain where
    she was as long as there was room for\r\nher.\r\n\r\n  `I wish you wouldn't squeeze
    so.' said the Dormouse, who was\r\nsitting next to her.  `I can hardly breathe.'\r\n\r\n 
    `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly:  `I'm growing.'\r\n\r\n  `You've no
    right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.\r\n\r\n  `Don't talk nonsense,' said
    Alice more boldly:  `you know\r\nyou're growing too.'\r\n\r\n  `Yes, but I grow
    at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:\r\n`not in that ridiculous fashion.' 
    And he got up very sulkily\r\nand crossed over to the other side of the court.\r\n\r\n 
    All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the\r\nHatter, and, just
    as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to\r\none of the officers of the
    court, `Bring me the list of the\r\nsingers in the last concert!' on which the
    wretched Hatter\r\ntrembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.\r\n\r\n  `Give
    your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have\r\nyou executed, whether
    you're nervous or not.'\r\n\r\n  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began,
    in a\r\ntrembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week\r\nor
    so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and\r\nthe twinkling
    of the tea--'\r\n\r\n  `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.\r\n\r\n  `It
    began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.\r\n\r\n  `Of course twinkling begins
    with a T!' said the King sharply.\r\n`Do you take me for a dunce?  Go on!'\r\n\r\n 
    `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things\r\ntwinkled after that--only
    the March Hare said--'\r\n\r\n  `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great
    hurry.\r\n\r\n  `You did!' said the Hatter.\r\n\r\n  `I deny it!' said the March
    Hare.\r\n\r\n  `He denies it,' said the King:  `leave out that part.'\r\n\r\n 
    `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,\r\nlooking anxiously
    round to see if he would deny it too:  but the\r\nDormouse denied nothing, being
    fast asleep.\r\n\r\n  `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-\r\nand-butter--'\r\n\r\n 
    `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.\r\n\r\n  `That I can't
    remember,' said the Hatter.\r\n\r\n  `You MUST remember,' remarked the King,
    `or I'll have you\r\nexecuted.'\r\n\r\n  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup
    and bread-and-butter,\r\nand went down on one knee.  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,'
    he\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n  `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.\r\n\r\n  Here
    one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately\r\nsuppressed by the officers
    of the court.  (As that is rather a\r\nhard word, I will just explain to you
    how it was done.  They had\r\na large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth
    with strings:\r\ninto this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then
    sat\r\nupon it.)\r\n\r\n  `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.  `I've
    so often\r\nread in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some\r\nattempts
    at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the\r\nofficers of the court,\"
    and I never understood what it meant\r\ntill now.'\r\n\r\n  `If that's all you
    know about it, you may stand down,'\r\ncontinued the King.\r\n\r\n  `I can't
    go no lower,' said the Hatter:  `I'm on the floor, as\r\nit is.'\r\n\r\n  `Then
    you may SIT down,' the King replied.\r\n\r\n  Here the other guinea-pig cheered,
    and was suppressed.\r\n\r\n  `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 
    `Now we\r\nshall get on better.'\r\n\r\n  `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the
    Hatter, with an anxious\r\nlook at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\r\n\r\n 
    `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the\r\ncourt, without
    even waiting to put his shoes on.\r\n\r\n  `--and just take his head off outside,'
    the Queen added to one\r\nof the officers:  but the Hatter was out of sight before
    the\r\nofficer could get to the door.\r\n\r\n  `Call the next witness!' said
    the King.\r\n\r\n  The next witness was the Duchess's cook.  She carried the\r\npepper-box
    in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before\r\nshe got into the court,
    by the way the people near the door began\r\nsneezing all at once.\r\n\r\n  `Give
    your evidence,' said the King.\r\n\r\n  `Shan't,' said the cook.\r\n\r\n  The
    King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a\r\nlow voice, `Your
    Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'\r\n\r\n  `Well, if I must, I must,'
    the King said, with a melancholy\r\nair, and, after folding his arms and frowning
    at the cook till\r\nhis eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice,
    `What\r\nare tarts made of?'\r\n\r\n  `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.\r\n\r\n 
    `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.\r\n\r\n  `Collar that Dormouse,' the
    Queen shrieked out.  `Behead that\r\nDormouse!  Turn that Dormouse out of court! 
    Suppress him!  Pinch\r\nhim!  Off with his whiskers!'\r\n\r\n  For some minutes
    the whole court was in confusion, getting the\r\nDormouse turned out, and, by
    the time they had settled down\r\nagain, the cook had disappeared.\r\n\r\n  `Never
    mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.\r\n`Call the next witness.' 
    And he added in an undertone to the\r\nQueen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine
    the next witness.\r\nIt quite makes my forehead ache!'\r\n\r\n  Alice watched
    the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,\r\nfeeling very curious to see
    what the next witness would be like,\r\n`--for they haven't got much evidence
    YET,' she said to herself.\r\nImagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read
    out, at the top\r\nof his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          
    CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                        Alice's Evidence\r\n\r\n\r\n  `Here!'
    cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the\r\nmoment how large she had
    grown in the last few minutes, and she\r\njumped up in such a hurry that she
    tipped over the jury-box with\r\nthe edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen
    on to the heads\r\nof the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding\r\nher
    very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset\r\nthe week before.\r\n\r\n 
    `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great\r\ndismay, and began
    picking them up again as quickly as she could,\r\nfor the accident of the goldfish
    kept running in her head, and\r\nshe had a vague sort of idea that they must
    be collected at once\r\nand put back into the jury-box, or they would die.\r\n\r\n 
    `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave\r\nvoice, `until all
    the jurymen are back in their proper places--\r\nALL,' he repeated with great
    emphasis, looking hard at Alice as\r\nhe said do.\r\n\r\n  Alice looked at the
    jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she\r\nhad put the Lizard in head downwards,
    and the poor little thing\r\nwas waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being
    quite unable\r\nto move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that\r\nit
    signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it\r\nwould be QUITE as
    much use in the trial one way up as the other.'\r\n\r\n  As soon as the jury
    had a little recovered from the shock of\r\nbeing upset, and their slates and
    pencils had been found and\r\nhanded back to them, they set to work very diligently
    to write\r\nout a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed\r\ntoo
    much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,\r\ngazing up into the
    roof of the court.\r\n\r\n  `What do you know about this business?' the King
    said to\r\nAlice.\r\n\r\n  `Nothing,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Nothing WHATEVER?'
    persisted the King.\r\n\r\n  `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `That's
    very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.\r\nThey were just beginning
    to write this down on their slates, when\r\nthe White Rabbit interrupted:  `UNimportant,
    your Majesty means,\r\nof course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning
    and\r\nmaking faces at him as he spoke.\r\n\r\n  `UNimportant, of course, I meant,'
    the King hastily said, and\r\nwent on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--\r\nunimportant--important--'
    as if he were trying which word\r\nsounded best.\r\n\r\n  Some of the jury wrote
    it down `important,' and some\r\n`unimportant.'  Alice could see this, as she
    was near enough to\r\nlook over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,'
    she\r\nthought to herself.\r\n\r\n  At this moment the King, who had been for
    some time busily\r\nwriting in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read
    out\r\nfrom his book, `Rule Forty-two.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE\r\nHIGH
    TO LEAVE THE COURT.'\r\n\r\n  Everybody looked at Alice.\r\n\r\n  `I'M not a
    mile high,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `You are,' said the King.\r\n\r\n  `Nearly two
    miles high,' added the Queen.\r\n\r\n  `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said
    Alice:  `besides,\r\nthat's not a regular rule:  you invented it just now.'\r\n\r\n 
    `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.\r\n\r\n  `Then it ought to
    be Number One,' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  The King turned pale, and shut his note-book
    hastily.\r\n`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n 
    `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said\r\nthe White Rabbit,
    jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has\r\njust been picked up.'\r\n\r\n 
    `What's in it?' said the Queen.\r\n\r\n  `I haven't opened it yet,' said the
    White Rabbit, `but it seems\r\nto be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to
    somebody.'\r\n\r\n  `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was\r\nwritten
    to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'\r\n\r\n  `Who is it directed to?' said
    one of the jurymen.\r\n\r\n  `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit;
    `in fact,\r\nthere's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper\r\nas
    he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set\r\nof verses.'\r\n\r\n 
    `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of\r\nthey jurymen.\r\n\r\n 
    `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the\r\nqueerest thing about
    it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)\r\n\r\n  `He must have imitated somebody
    else's hand,' said the King.\r\n(The jury all brightened up again.)\r\n\r\n 
    `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and\r\nthey can't
    prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'\r\n\r\n  `If you didn't sign
    it,' said the King, `that only makes the\r\nmatter worse.  You MUST have meant
    some mischief, or else you'd\r\nhave signed your name like an honest man.'\r\n\r\n 
    There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the\r\nfirst really clever
    thing the King had said that day.\r\n\r\n  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the
    Queen.\r\n\r\n  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't\r\neven
    know what they're about!'\r\n\r\n  `Read them,' said the King.\r\n\r\n  The White
    Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,\r\nplease your Majesty?'
    he asked.\r\n\r\n  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on\r\ntill
    you come to the end:  then stop.'\r\n\r\n  These were the verses the White Rabbit
    read:--\r\n\r\n        `They told me you had been to her,\r\n          And mentioned
    me to him:\r\n        She gave me a good character,\r\n          But said I could
    not swim.\r\n\r\n        He sent them word I had not gone\r\n          (We know
    it to be true):\r\n        If she should push the matter on,\r\n          What
    would become of you?\r\n\r\n        I gave her one, they gave him two,\r\n         
    You gave us three or more;\r\n        They all returned from him to you,\r\n         
    Though they were mine before.\r\n\r\n        If I or she should chance to be\r\n         
    Involved in this affair,\r\n        He trusts to you to set them free,\r\n         
    Exactly as we were.\r\n\r\n        My notion was that you had been\r\n         
    (Before she had this fit)\r\n        An obstacle that came between\r\n         
    Him, and ourselves, and it.\r\n\r\n        Don't let him know she liked them
    best,\r\n          For this must ever be\r\n        A secret, kept from all the
    rest,\r\n          Between yourself and me.'\r\n\r\n  `That's the most important
    piece of evidence we've heard yet,'\r\nsaid the King, rubbing his hands; `so
    now let the jury--'\r\n\r\n  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice,
    (she had\r\ngrown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit\r\nafraid
    of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't\r\nbelieve there's
    an atom of meaning in it.'\r\n\r\n  The jury all wrote down on their slates,
    `SHE doesn't believe\r\nthere's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted
    to\r\nexplain the paper.\r\n\r\n  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King,
    `that saves a\r\nworld of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. 
    And\r\nyet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his\r\nknee,
    and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some\r\nmeaning in them, after
    all.  \"--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--\" you\r\ncan't swim, can you?' he added, turning
    to the Knave.\r\n\r\n  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?'
    he said.\r\n(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)\r\n\r\n 
    `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering\r\nover the verses
    to himself:  `\"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--\" that's\r\nthe jury, of course-- \"I
    GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--\" why,\r\nthat must be what he did with the
    tarts, you know--'\r\n\r\n  `But, it goes on \"THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO
    YOU,\"' said\r\nAlice.\r\n\r\n  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly,
    pointing to\r\nthe tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.\r\nThen
    again--\"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--\"  you never had fits, my\r\ndear, I think?'
    he said to the Queen.\r\n\r\n  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an
    inkstand at the\r\nLizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left
    off\r\nwriting on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no\r\nmark;
    but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was\r\ntrickling down his
    face, as long as it lasted.)\r\n\r\n  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the
    King, looking round\r\nthe court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.\r\n\r\n 
    `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and\r\neverybody laughed, `Let
    the jury consider their verdict,' the\r\nKing said, for about the twentieth time
    that day.\r\n\r\n  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'\r\n\r\n 
    `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having\r\nthe sentence
    first!'\r\n\r\n  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.\r\n\r\n 
    `I won't!' said Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the
    top of her voice.\r\nNobody moved.\r\n\r\n  `Who cares for you?' said Alice,
    (she had grown to her full\r\nsize by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack
    of cards!'\r\n\r\n  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying\r\ndown
    upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half\r\nof anger, and
    tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on\r\nthe bank, with her head
    in the lap of her sister, who was gently\r\nbrushing away some dead leaves that
    had fluttered down from the\r\ntrees upon her face.\r\n\r\n  `Wake up, Alice
    dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long\r\nsleep you've had!'\r\n\r\n  `Oh,
    I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told\r\nher sister, as well
    as she could remember them, all these strange\r\nAdventures of hers that you
    have just been reading about; and\r\nwhen she had finished, her sister kissed
    her, and said, `It WAS a\r\ncurious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to
    your tea; it's\r\ngetting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while
    she\r\nran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.\r\n\r\n  But
    her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her\r\nhead on her hand, watching
    the setting sun, and thinking of\r\nlittle Alice and all her wonderful Adventures,
    till she too began\r\ndreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--\r\n\r\n 
    First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the\r\ntiny hands
    were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes\r\nwere looking up into
    hers--she could hear the very tones of her\r\nvoice, and see that queer little
    toss of her head to keep back\r\nthe wandering hair that WOULD always get into
    her eyes--and\r\nstill as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place\r\naround
    her became alive the strange creatures of her little\r\nsister's dream.\r\n\r\n 
    The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried\r\nby--the frightened
    Mouse splashed his way through the\r\nneighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle
    of the teacups as\r\nthe March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending
    meal,\r\nand the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate\r\nguests
    to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the\r\nDuchess's knee, while
    plates and dishes crashed around it--once\r\nmore the shriek of the Gryphon,
    the squeaking of the Lizard's\r\nslate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed
    guinea-pigs,\r\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable\r\nMock
    Turtle.\r\n\r\n  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\r\nWonderland,
    though she knew she had but to open them again, and\r\nall would change to dull
    reality--the grass would be only\r\nrustling in the wind, and the pool rippling
    to the waving of the\r\nreeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling
    sheep-\r\nbells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd\r\nboy--and
    the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and\r\nall thy other queer
    noises, would change (she knew) to the\r\nconfused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while
    the lowing of the\r\ncattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock
    Turtle's\r\nheavy sobs.\r\n\r\n  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same
    little sister of\r\nhers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman;
    and how\r\nshe would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and\r\nloving
    heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about\r\nher other little children,
    and make THEIR eyes bright and eager\r\nwith many a strange tale, perhaps even
    with the dream of\r\nWonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all
    their\r\nsimple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,\r\nremembering
    her own child-life, and the happy summer days.\r\n\r\n                            
    THE END\r\n"
